It was then that O Estado de S. Paulo, reading the New York Times, learned of the existence of a Flavio Alterthum.
People like to be on the crest of a good wave.
In fact, I am happy.
Marcos Pivetta
With a thick accent that still betrays his native Buenos Aires, physician and neuroscientist Iván Izquierdo, 66 years old, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), is one of the greatest specialists in the physiology of the memory in the world.
"We are precisely what we remember, and we are also what we do not want to remember", says this assiduous reader of his fellow countryman Jorge Luis Borges.
Izquierdo, incidentally, frequently resorts to idols from sport -- and from literature -- to explain concepts of the neurosciences, as the reader will see in this interview.
This started in the mid-1980s, when there began to be useful models on which one could work.
It is different from the memory for learning more, and different from recollection.
We remember episodes from our own lives, animals too.
One day you go there, and the window is closed.
Without it, people would have no physical space in the brain to think.
We arewhat we remember -- and we are also what we do not want to remember.
But, from what has been seen up until now, this capacity is never going to reintegrate a memory that has disappeared.
It is quickly saturated in rats, and in humans for sure.
Why do some people have, or say they have, a better memory for faces, and others for names or numbers?
-- This is usually due to practice.
This is one aspect of the question.
-- Yes, yes, generally in an unconscious way.
-- It is by far and away the best way.
-- I read Borges a lot.
This group will be headed up in part by researcher Sidarta Ribeiro (from Duke University), who is in the United States at the moment, but is coming back.
The quantity and the quality of these groups are surprising me.
In São Paulo, there is an extremely interesting group at the Ludwig Cancer Research Institute, with which we are collaborating.
There are several large neurochemistry groups of the very highest level in Rio de Janeiro.
-- This is an enormous Brazilian characteristic, and a grave defect.
It is a trait that, I think, makes it possible to lead a lighter life, apparently easier.
But, actually, it is more difficult, because one tends to fall into the same errors and not give due importance to things.
You are retired, you are 82 years of age, but on this trip to Brazil you have a full schedule, visiting various cities in the country.
What will make up this hectic program?
The group that I had coordinated before retiring continues experimenting on what I had begun there at the CERN, and they think they have discovered the plasma of quark-gluon.
From this collision of the nuclei, if the phenomenon actually exists, the protons and the neutrons should dissociate themselves into quarks and gluons.
Consequently, we don't need plasma to explain their production.
-- The Polytechnic of Paris has opened its doors to many countries.
Since I am a Brazilian, they spoke with me to see if I was interested in helping to make contact with Brazilian universities.
This wasn't so common in the decades of the 60s and 70s, is that not so?
I really enjoyed the course, I really enjoyed the logic of physics.
He talked to me as if he were preparing me for a catastrophe.
Did you yourself get to know those cited by Professor Wataghin?
Einstein and Fermi died more or less at that period between 1954 and 1955.
But I was never linked to any political party and didn't take part in any political activity.
We spent many hours there and had lunch with the officers.
Admiral Álvaro Alberto, at that time the President of the CNPq participated in the visit and by chance during the lunch, I sat down next to him.
I told him that I wanted to go to England on a grant and he counseled me not to ask for it at that moment.
I went off to study for my master's degree at Manchester University.
I had been in Brasilia only a few months and had not asked for leave of absence from the CERN.
For how long did you resist?
Darcy Ribeiro was the university rector for only a few months.
It was at that time that I arrived at the UnB.
Anything that was to happen at the university was known by the secret service within a quarter of an hour afterwards.
If there was to be a seminar in the amphitheater there would be policemen present.
So I ended up returning to Geneva.
Also missing are years of experience of the scientific community, with an acute critical spirit, within a maturing process, so that the people involved in the work acquire the habit of going as deep as possible into the specific problem that they are studying, of going to the final consequences so that they can prove themselves.
At forty seven years of age Fernando Reinach is a rare person -- at least for now -- both in the scientific environment and in the Brazilian entrepreneurial scenario.
Focused on the biochemistry of muscles for his doctorate thesis at Cornell, in the United States, and afterwards in his post-doctorate work at Cambridge, UK, Reinach returned to Brazil in 1986, with a strong sense of autonomy, enough to take the professor's examination for the Biochemical Department of the University of São Paulo (USP) without, shall we say, asking for permission or the blessings of any of the great masters in the area.
He entered, advanced and rapidly attained the top of his career, or that is to say, became a full professor at the age of thirty five -- a post from which he is presently on leave of absence.
The scientific community was small, but major researchers existed.
And this, I believe, is now happening at the CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development).
As well, there were a series of favorable factors for theXylella project that had happened right below our very nose and that we managed to see.
It is gratifying to see that, all of a sudden, there was a generation that carried out one of Brazil's most important research projects without unanimous consent.
How did you establish the project and afterwards the organism that you were going to sequence?
the first paper by Craig Venture concerning the genome had been published.
On the 1st of May weekend in 1997, I had been at my country house in Piracaia, and thought: OK, instead of having an infrastructure project, let's do a genome project, bringing together everyone within a single objective.
The machine was called the "The Thing".
It was the keyboard of a telephone with a plastic devise that allowed the film to be viewed.
And Meidanis was the only person who said "I'm going to visit all the laboratories".
We were running against time.
And shortly afterwards the sugarcane project was launched?
-- You carry out a genome project when you sequence the total DNA of an organism, all of its genes.
Either I reach the other side or I fall into the hole.
I believe that in Brazil one of these projects with absolutely clear objectives is lacking.
And this is no criticism, knowledge has distinct phases.
The research was directed in the sense that it had an organ that said "let's do it", but equally it was not because it was not born outside of the scientific community.
But how often did the Federation of Industries of São Paulo (Fiesp) or the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) come to FAPESP to say: we need science from you?
-- It's beginning.
With one of the most singular biographies from the world of science and technology in Brazil, José Ellis Ripper Filho, 65 years old, is a businessman in the telecommunications area, as the president of AsGa, a company that produces equipment for transmissions via optical fiber.
-- Today, there are two, we have had three before.
They do development.
A survey by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)?
The greater part of the companies in Brazil, even those that do R&D, do not even know that they do R&D.
But some actually do it.
It is an apprenticeship in the method of learning?
By making students participate in the process of creating knowledge, the university makes these citizens imbued in the process.
I think I made her head spin, because there were two questions running.
On the first attempt, Rogério arrives in Rio, enthusiastic, in a period of vacations.
To which I responded: "Rogério, I'm not going to the UnB".
When you joined ITA, did you have the idea of being a professor, a businessman?
A little while ago I gave a talk there at ITA, in a seminar on innovation.
Being educated at ITA, and particularly education before the movement of 1964, was in actually a school for leaderships.
ITA became famous because it has exceptional students, who remain locked up for five years, in an exhausting regime of studies.
They put me to visit the recording companies to ask for donations of records in exchange for playing them on the radio.
With the fame that ITA acquired, doing a nationwide entrance exam, it began to attract the best people in Brazil, and it continues to be an excellent school, in spite of not having good professors.
Do they know about this opinion of yours?
Alencastro arrived and went into a conversation with Zeferino.
-- No, there was none.
When we began to work, it became obvious that we would have neither the resources nor the time to carry out our original idea, something that could be industrialized afterwards.
-- Alfred Voeffner, André Massareli and Fernando Vieira de Souza.
It wasn't work for a course.
The closest I came to the industry was at Bell Labs, and it was not so close as all that.
-- To make components, lasers, and detectors.
Last December, one of the vice-presidents of the GlaxoSmithKline laboratories, Allen Roses, told the British newspaper The Independent that the major part of the remedies produced by his company did not act as expected in over half of the people.
They do not produce any effect.
Imagine a person who has suffered a stroke.
The same happens with Alzheimer's disease.
There's an interesting phrase on this issue said by Sir William Osler [a Canadian author and the author of The principles and practice of medicine, of 1892,a landmark in the area of health at the beginning of the 20th century ].
-- There are today medicines that really do act against given diseases.
But it is a relative benefit, since 80% of the patients would not suffer from a further heart attack, even if they did not take aspirin.
With the medicine, the person's glycemia does not increase, but studies carried out in Germany -- in Europe, people are more careful with this -- show that people die in the same way.
Wouldn't it be better to publish the studies in a scientific magazine?
Because the first one has its costs, its added value, period.
Incidentally, medicine only progresses with medicaments.
Its effectiveness is something that the market may eventually clarify.
There were several techniques for operating.
There are fewer and fewer surgeries in urology and in gastroenterology.
Not here.
As we didn't have a law on patents, what advantage was there to be interested in synthesizing a medicine if it was possible to copy it.
I think it's stupidity.
If you analyze it well, a major part of American science is done by foreigners.
How should it be done?
-- No.
I think it's absurd and have already told them so.
In economic terms, it doesn't work out cheap.
They play with purchasing power to lower the price.
To which professional?
That's where the biggest atrocities are done. .
The result was that she sent only one ticket by sea for her daughter, and Farkas was born in Hungary.
We went by jeep.
-- Yes, but it so happens that [Eduardo] Coutinho was there in those days, and the repression came down on top of him.
I took the first four films to TV Cultura to see if they wanted to show them, but as it was the time of the dictatorship, someone said to me, ``Look, there's a lot of misery''.
-- I had a C-14 [a Chevrolet pickup truck].
I had in my hands a study done by a geography teacher saying what there was in each place in Brazil, what was cultivated etc.
Afterwards, we went to a nearby city, where we discovered a host of other things: a cassava meal place, a bomb factory...
The idea was to film how Brazilians from each place live, what there real production was.
I had everything: an editing machine, a camera and a tape recorder.
And I ended up at the police department, arrested, because of that and other nonsense.
-- No, that was Brasil verdade [True Brazil].
Birri and Edgardo Pallero, Argentineans, had got the photo documentary craze badly.
In a way, I think that our political vision was just one, it was a vision of transforming things, improving things.
I have that to this date.
I am a raving optimist.
Were you connected with the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB), the Big Party?
-- That is what it was.
Let's talk about your life as a teacher: did you go to USP's Communication and Arts School (ECA) to teach photojournalism?
But with the professors it was more difficult.
And why did you do a doctorate?
Incidentally, I always tell the same story: he stayed because he had a particular way of dealing with the people here.
-- Just this one.
I designed Fotoptica's laboratory, and afterwards ECA's photography laboratory.
``Do you want t be a doctor?''
Because there were 50 places, but 57 passed.
And at that moment we sold out to a bank.
Married and a mother of three (two sons and one daughter), she studies not only gender issues in the sciences but has also focused, together with her graduate students, on understanding why there are so few women in fields such as physics, mathematics and engineering.
You have written several articles about Brazilian involvement in international research networks, such as those dedicated to bioprospection and to the Aids vaccine.
Brazilian participation in these networks became rather questionable.
One of the things we are lacking is more human resources being trained abroad, now that we have strengthened our post-graduate studies.
``There were many Japanese companies, especially in the eighties and nineties, that sent their technicians to do doctorates at Caltech, at Berkeley or at the major US technological centers.
Well, that said, one cannot oblige a company to hire a Ph.D.
``I think that this is clear for companies, that they must be competitive.
What will be the long-term effect of training PhDs without having jobs for them?
Many people enter a university, do their master's degree and their doctorate and then take a civil service exam.
It's very difficult to compare countries in this way.
One may compare Brazil to itself and say: Brazilian scientific production has grown significantly over time.
``To my mind, no.
The creators of the Science Citation Index did not devise the database for evaluation purposes, but as a tool for researchers to find out who was working in the same field of knowledge as they were.''
But this is very questionable.
For instance, in Germany, France and Holland, social sciences are largely published locally and in the local language.
Using the impact factor of this periodical as a measure of the quality of a publication or, even worse, of an author is to imagine that anybody can evaluate Brazil's scientific policies just because the database is available on the Internet: you key in a name, go click and find a number of citations for an author, an institution or a country.
We are here for historical reasons that they are very well aware of.''
What about Argentina?
``Yes.
It is said that the reason why Brazil has never won a Nobel prize is the lack of original contributions from our researchers.
I don't think we should shut out the world.
The current notion of innovation didn't even exist.
The line of discourse was: `CNPq shelves are full of research that needs to be made available to companies.'
One may question this option, but, once it has been made, I believe you have to join it, otherwise others will.
But after the seventh grade, which is when one starts teaching more complex mathematics, they start doing worse than the boys.
When you ask the girls, they say: `I think your job prospects are better.'
That stuck in my head and, as I have this great dream, which is to be a storyteller - I began to take courses, even getting a certificate - I thought that by doing a children's book I might have the opportunity to begin telling stories to small groups and make my knowledge available to people.
When you give an answer that brings together some element that the person already knows, it encourages them to follow along with whatever you are proposing.
It demanded a change to do, hear, think, re-do, until reaching a satisfactory point.
I have never had the return I have now, so I was very pleased when my 4 year old granddaughter asked me one day: "Hey Grandpa, did you bring the book of pathogens?".
And there you have it, a natural glue.
It's the simplest thing, from questions.
While we have 1012cells, or so.
So you can understand why a pneumonia virus can knock a person down.
In 1975 the ``Pro-Alcohol Program'' was initiated in Brazil, which used S. cerevisiae to produce alcohol.
It is a vastly different scale and the problems involved are also different.
Soon I saw that he was starting a new project: using a genetically modified bacterium to produce ethanol using genes from Zymomonas mobilis.
These are the settings.
When I say use, I mean to grow and multiply.
To what extent was this knowledge added to the manufacturing process in Brazil and the United States?
Because you simply have to do something called enzymatic hydrolysis, or chemical hydrolysis.
It already has an organized metabolic pathway.
Research depends on people and money.
Great because alcohol will be important.
Okay, research helps a lot when a person combines this sort of practical experience with knowledge.
To get involved with it, I had to leave the university.
When the patent was about to expire, I received a letter from the University of Florida saying: we are going to pay you royalties .
