Recollections and omissions
Neuroscientist talks about the importance of memories and also of forgetting
Productive as few, owner of a curriculum with over 500 scientific articles, which have now been cited almost 8,000 times in works of other researchers, Izquierdo has conducted studies that, in the last three decades, have helped to understand the role performed by chemical substances and brain structures in the formation, preservation, and loss of recollections and memories.
One of his most important contributions was to demonstrate that there are two divisions of memory, the short term one and the long term, which are formed in parallel, but in a different way.
He lived three years in São Paulo, where he worked at the São Paulo Medicine School (today, the Federal University of São Paulo), before settling in Porto Alegre.
He used to think that Brazil was just one stopping place in his life, but he was wrong.
He ended up staying, because, amongst other reasons, here, the military dictatorship beckoned with the prospect of a slow and gradual opening up of the regime.
"And in Argentina, there came a sudden and total closure", he explains.
In 1981, when he felt himself to be "one more at home" in the new country, he was naturalized as a Brazilian.
Today, he defines himself as a "Meligeni of science", in a reference to tennis player Fernando Meligeni, born in Argentina and also naturalized Brazilian.
Formally retired since last year, he continues on active service, heading up the Biosciences Center's Memory Center, at UFRGS.
Why did you decide to study the mechanisms of the memory?
-- Because I thought -- and still do -- that it is a mechanism that has something mysterious behind it, something to do with who we are.
We are individuals because we have a memory.
We are precisely that which we remember.
Each one of us has a certain stock of memory that is peculiarly ours, which we do not share with anyone.
All this seemed to me sufficiently interesting for me to dedicate the rest of my life to this theme.
How much is there today of a mystery for science on the question of memory?
-- Well, there will always be one mystery, which is the fact that memory involves, in a certain way, transformations of the reality that people see, or that people feel, into a neural code.
And, afterwards, perhaps this neural code -- which is both electrical and chemical -- retransforms itself into memories, recollections.
What are the main contributions given by your research group for a better understanding of how memory is formed?
-- The first great contribution of ours, together with other groups, was determining the major brain mechanisms that modulate the memory, with various mechanisms mediated by neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, or by hormones, like adrenaline, beta-endorphin, vasopressin, and the corticoids.
This was in the 1970s.
The modulation of the memory by all these substances makes the formation and recollection of the memory so sensitive to the emotions and states of spirit.
More recently, we identified which molecular substrates of the areas of the brain these substances act on, to form and recall memories, and in what way.
This line of research allowed us to get to know in detail the molecular sequence of the processes of forming memory in the hippocampus and in other regions of the brain.
The third major contribution was the division of the memory into short and long-term memory.
Contrary to what used to be thought, we demonstrated that the divisions of the memory are two parallel and differentiated processes.
We demonstrated that the short-term memory was not the initial part of the other, the long term memory.
This is of great importance in the pathology of the memory.
The most recent contributions of ours consisted in identifying the mechanisms involved in recollection in several regions of the brain, the molecular mechanisms for extinguishing memories, and, recently, the mechanisms which proved to be a different kind of memory: memory for learning once again.
Could you explain in more detail the workings of these two divisions of the memory, the short- term memory and the long-term one?
-- They are two memories that are triggered at the same time, which are formed in the same nerve cells, but which use separate molecular mechanisms.
You learn something, and the definitive memory of this thing that you (or any other animal) learned takes several hours to be formed.
Even so, while this long-term memory has not been constructed, you manage to respond (to a question that involves this learning process).
For us to be able to talk during this interview, you do not have to wait for the memory of the previous sentence to consolidate, which will take several hours.
You answer straight away to what I say, and I answer to what you say.
For us to do this, we use a system that is parallel to the long term memory, a simpler system, a little more elementary and less stable, which is called short term memory.
It is like the working memory (RAM) of a computer.
How long does this short term memory subsist for?
-- More or less from three to six hours.
The best analogy that I know to differentiate these two memories is the situation of when we will live in a hotel while they are building our house.
The hotel is the short term, provisional, memory, and the house will be the long term memory.
What is your main line of research today?
-- From the 1990s, more or less, we began to work in collaboration with Jorge Medina's group, from the School of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires, on the mechanisms that really take part in the memory.
In those days, it began to become clear in the world that the main neurotransmitter is none of the ones I mentioned before, but glutamic acid.
The great excitatory transmission in the brain is glutamatergic, and the great inhibitory transmission is by the amino acid called gamma-amino butyric acid.
We then started to study the mechanisms that are spurred or put into action by these compounds.
While Eric Kandel (Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000), for example, was demonstrating the molecular mechanisms of neuron plasticity in mollusks, we went on to study the same processes, or others like them, in memories of mammals.
More specifically, what is the theme of your more recent works?
-- We have not yet finished writing the work, but we are demonstrating that when people learn twice, they use different mechanisms from those used to learn something once.
Learning is different in one or two lessons.
You use another place in the brain.
To learn twice, you use the same mechanism that is involved in habits, located in the caudate nucleus.
To learn once, whether you are learning a lot or a little, the hippocampus is used more.
This may perhaps be very important, because the majority of things we don't learn well straight off, but in several sessions.
Is this distinction valid for the process of learning concepts?
-- I don't know.
For the time being, we know that this difference appears in rats that learn not to come down from a platform to avoid getting a shock.
It is the learning of an induced behavior, a conditioned reflex.
But, look, all learning processes can be reduced to behaviors or sequences of behaviors.
All of them.
Could you explain the two major types of memory, declarative memory and procedural memory?
-- In general, declarative memories are those that humans can express, can declare that they exist.
For example, the memory of medicine.
I can say and demonstrate that I remember things from medicine.
In animals, it's more difficult to identify this kind of memory.
Declarative memories can be semantic or episodic.
We remember concepts of big things, like medicine, and animals as well.
The procedural memories are those that involve habits, like, for example, knowing how to use a keyboard, how to swim, ride a bike.
These are procedures.
It's difficult to explain this kind of memory, to declare that it exists; it can only be demonstrated by practicing a procedure: using a keyboard, actually swimming, really riding a bicycle.
Why, with time, do people lose their memories, even the long term ones?
-- There are various ways of losing memories.
One is actual loss, which occurs when a synapse atrophies for lack of use, or disappears from damage or cell death.
This is forgetting properly speaking; here, the memories actually disappear, because the cells that contained them disappear.
But there are other ways of losing memories, at least of apparently losing.
One of them is extinction, in which the memories are not lost; they are hived off to a less accessible place of the brain.
In some cranny, there they are.
Their representation exists, but is annulled by imposing a new learning process over the old one.
Do you mean that extinct memories can be recovered?
-- In theory, yes.
They can often be recovered, but not always.
Suppose, for example, that you are used to going every day to a bank teller's window to get money.
So, you then change your behavior.
When you finally realize that the window is remaining closed, you stop going there.
You extinguish this behavior.
But, if one day, by chance, you pass by the window and notice that it is open, you go there and get your money.
Extinction is one of the ways of sweeping a memory beneath the carpet.
It's useful, it's necessary.
It wouldn't be possible to compare things, since we would always be remembering that they are similar and would never be able to notice the differences.
Or that they are different and we would never notice the similarities.
What are the other forms of losing memories?
-- Another interesting form is Freudian repression, which nobody has talked about in 70 or 80 years, except the Freudians.
But now it has come back onto the scene as a fundamental process.
An American group found the mechanism of Freudian repression, which is different from extinction.
The group led by John Gabrieli (from Stanford University) discovered that the prefrontal area of the brain, right at the tip of the frontal lobe, has the hippocampus inhibited, the region that is most involved in recalling memory.
It has the brakes put on the recollection, for example, of a certain word.
In practice, it is as if the repressed memory were absent, although it is not and may always come back.
Freudian repression and extinction of the memory are two fundamental weapons for us to be able to survive.
I have just written a book A arte de esquecer [The art of forgetting], in which I say that to forget is something good, necessary.
But we do not have total control over this process.
In other words, we often remember things we wanted to forget, and we forget others that we wanted to remember.
-- We aren't perfect.
As the years go by, the number of memories we have gets bigger and bigger.
In real forgetting, as we have seen, the bases of the memory get lost from the inactivity of the nerve circuits involved in one or other memory, or by the real loss of neurons, which happens with age, with degenerative diseases, etc.
In Alzheimer's disease, for example, neurons die, synapses die -- as do the memories that were contained in them.
Is there today any effective treatment against memory problems?
Against Alzheimer's, for example?
-- There is still no treatment for Alzheimer.
In this case, there is neuron death, and the lost neurons cannot be replaced with the original information.
Could the way out be to replace these neurons?
In the last few years, it has been discovered that some places in the brain have the capacity for neuron replacement, amongst them the hippocampus.
It may make it possible for the machine to be set up again, so as to be able to make a new memory.
And for lesser losses of memory and in younger people, are there treatments?
-- Yes, but there are no medicines.
What there are forms of training the memory, usually based on reading.
Medicines are no use, because the brain, at every particular moment, is already doing all it can, given the circumstances of feelings and emotions inherent in every moment.
And the memories that have been learnt or recalled at previous moments.
Why do you usually say that forgetting is necessary for man?
-- It's fundamental, because otherwise there would, literally, be no room in the brain for so much information.
There are several recent studies to which little importance has been paid, but which are fundamental for understanding this.
A Norwegian group, in collaboration with an English researcher, has shown that the hippocampus is the main region of the brain that makes and recalls declarative memories.
An animal uses 40% of the total structure of the hippocampus to learn a given spatial notion.
To recall this learning, it uses 60% of the hippocampus.
During the time that it is learning or recalling this spatial learning, the animal cannot do anything else.
So this means that the capacity installed in the brain is not infinite, it's not so big as all that.
We even have physical experiences of this saturation.
We goto a congress, we listen to two or three talks running, and we get impression that there is no more room in the brain for anything else.
At that moment, there really is no room.
So we go out of the room, take a break, have a cup of coffee.
After the dust has settled a bit, and the hippocampus has gone back to be used less, we can return to the room and listen to another talk.
That popular saying that knowledge does not take up any space makes no sense, then?
-- It does take up space.
Acquiring knowledge and recalling knowledge occupies a lot of space.
Generally speaking, the brain tends to use all the available resources for this task.
Do you mean that that story that humans use only a small percentage of the brain is a lot of nonsense?
-- To tell the truth, it's not possible to say whether this is right or not.
This is because we do not know how many neurons and synapses we have.
Until twenty years ago, it used to be thought that we had, I believe, 10 billion neurons.
Today, we know that there are at least 200 billion, perhaps 300 billion.
And between these two estimates there is a difference of 100 billion neurons.
Is it possible to train the brain to forget traumas or passages of life that one would no longer like to recall?
-- Sometimes, the brain does this automatically.
When it fails, we have what is called precisely posttraumatic stress or phobias.
But there are therapies which use precisely extinction and which are applied for an individual to extinguish stress.
The country where this has been studied most, odd though it may seem, is Turkey.
Turkey?
It's because in recent years they have had two tremendous earthquakes there.
And in one of them, tens of thousands of people died, a very high number.
After the catastrophes, Turkish neurologists and psychiatrists saw that there were loads of patients with posttraumatic stress, of people who had been in the places of the earthquakes but had survived.
They put into practice whatever they could to treat them and saw that extinction discovered by Pavlov and prescribed by Freud could be used.
Some of them supplemented the sessions of extinction with anxiolytic drugs, but this is not usually necessary.
What is the explanation for the so-called "memory going blank"?
Forgetting the home telephone number, for example?
When it is a more serious forgetfulness, like a student who studied for the university entrance exam and, on the day of the exam, remembers nothing, this blank is caused by stress.
With stress, large quantities of corticoids are released, secreted by the suprarenal gland; they inhibit recollection, acting on the hippocampus and on the tonsils.
Then I go blank.
It's a defensive act.
Bank clerks are good at numbers, men of letters at words, doctors are good with faces and for names.
Musicians are good with music.
This is not to mention the situation of people who present some congenital defects.
Those who are born with eyesight that is not very good are going to be worse in acquiring visual memories, compared to a person without this limitation.
But there is a certain system of compensation in these cases.
The blind develop their olfactory memory more, for example.
So he is going to lose many memories, but he is going to gain others.
There may be some muddle, which is proper to those who have a lot of information to handle, in some cases more and in others less.
Another is that people, as years go by, begin to change their memories, begin to falsify them.
It tells how memory is falsified.
People do this a lot.
But almost always in an unconscious way?
My mother used to mix me up with a brother of hers, who looked vaguely like me.
The two were men from the family, one was a brother, the other a son So she would attribute to me things that my uncle had done.
This is very common with people in general, and very common in the elderly in particular.
To tell the truth, everyone does this.
Did you say in an interview that the very act of recalling memory ends up leading to a certain loss of detail?
-- Maybe this is due to the fact that the way for extinguishing memories is by recalling them.
Recalling without reinforcing the recollection.
Now, when you go there and don't get the money, because the window is closed, it's the moment you start extinguishing this memory.
To extinguish, you have to recall.
Is this a paradox?
You need to recall and see that the information you had is useless.
Without carrying out this experience, it's difficult to extinguish memory.
Is reading the best way of preserving the memory?
There's nothing that approaches it.
By reading, you exercise the visual memory, the verbal memory, the memory of other languages you perhaps know, the memory of synonyms, the memory of images.
It is reading that recalls most kinds of memory, most forms of memory.
Reading a lot and having a good level of schooling also helps to prevent or to minimize the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
Famous blind writers have done this, and it has worked very well, like the Argentinean Jorge Luis Borges and England's John Milton.
You must be a great reader of Borges, because you always mention him in your interviews.
He called a lot of attention to memory.
Borges wrote a tale that is definitive on the question that we need to forget to be able to learn.
The tale is calledFunes the memorious .
Funes could remember a whole day of his life, during which he could do nothing else.
This situation, of course, was an impossibility, a demonstration by the absurd that the brain gets saturated.
What assessment do you make of the studies of the memory done in Brazil and abroad?
-- Here, there are few groups, but those that exist are good, of an international level.
Besides my group studying the memory, perhaps the largest in Brazil in this field of work, there are several others in Curitiba, São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza etc.
There is now a new nucleus being set up in Natal.
He recently published a scientific article about the importance of sleep for the formation of memory.
-- If anyone has formulated a really interesting hypothesis on this theme, it's probably Sidarta.
There are also several persons and many Brazilian groups, of psychiatry or neuropsychology, who are doing very good studies of memory.
15 or 20 years ago, this discipline was practically nonexistent in Brazil.
Now, every day, a new group appears.
Are the other areas of the neurosciences doing in Brazil?
-- They are doing very well.
They are studying neurochemistry.
With them, we are doing a lot in common about memory.
This group started its work much later than the others, but is now one of the groups in the vanguard.
My group itself is diversifying.
There are now several persons who are independent researchers.
There is Frederico Graeff, from USP in Ribeirão Preto, who has a big team working eagerly.
There are many groups, I wouldn't like to mention names, because the list is long and I would run the risk of forgetting some, as there are so many.
Why have neurosciences been a success?
Because...
Perhaps because we neuroscientists were full of enthusiasm and encouraged each other (he laughs).
I, Esper Cavalheiro, Cícero Coimbra (both from the Federal University of São Paulo), Roberto Lent, Rafael Linden (both from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), Luiz Roberto Giorgetti de Britto, Menna Barreto (from the University of São Paulo) have always got on very well.
You mentioned Natal.
It is going to bring people of an excellent level, and they are all going to be together, which would be very good.
Now, I get a bit apprehensive because Brazil is the country of the great projects that afterwards are not taken forward.
I like to say that science in Brazil is more or less like Ayrton Senna at the beginning of his career: he would set out in the lead, leaving everyone behind him, but he wouldn't finish the race.
We have had great projects in Brazil.
It lasted two tenders.
It had two tenders in the first year, after that never again.
Now, Pronex has come back, but in an extraordinarily reduced form.
It has come back with one tenth of the original amount.
And some states are outside the tender, like Rio Grande do Sul.
The project for the institute in Natal is a challenge.
They are proposing integration with private enterprise in support of the sciences.
Why did you become naturalized?
That was in 1981.
But do you see yourself more as an Argentinean or a Brazilian?
-- It's difficult to define, because you never lose your roots, but a long time later they get transformed, because of what has grown on top of them.
Going back to talking about memory, but in another sense, people are used to saying that Brazil is a country without a memory, with a social amnesia.
Do you agree with this statement?
Nobody remembers the candidate for which they voted for state deputy in the last election.
Nobody.
This was less than two years ago, and no one remembers.
Brazilians tend to take everything with a touch of superficiality, which is good sometimes.
But in real life.
Look, we have 33% of the country who are wretched, according to what has just been made public.
Nothing is happy or fun in the lives of these folks, because they don't eat enough, they don't have enough to clothe themselves.
And, when you get to the level of serious things, likedoing science and feeding the people, I think it is better to have seriousness than lightness.
The lightness of being, as writer Milan Kundera said, ends up being unbearable.
A high-energy physicist
Neldson Marcolin
Time appears not to be of much importance to the physicist Roberto Salmeron to judge by the manner with which he ignores it.
His routine would devastate any schedule, whether it be in Brazil or France.
His most common activities include conferences, lectures and courses, participation in official commissions, support for Brazilian physicists in international cooperation enterprises, counseling for Brazilian students abroad, interpretations of someone else's experiments, analysis of Brazilian scientific policy, articles and, more recently, planning for writing books.
When he has spare time, he likes to paint.
Perhaps all of this energy would not cause so much of a fright if the person in question was not eighty-two years of age and did not live on the other side of the Atlantic, in Paris.
Born in the city of São Paulo, physicist Salmeron is the son of factory workers who came from Spain.
He fulfilled his parents' dreams by graduating in engineering from the polytechnic College of the University of São Paulo (USP) at the end the 40s but quickly migrated to physics, won over by a fascination that would accompany him for years.
He was the last Brazilian assistant to the mythical Italian Professor Gleb Wataghin, who formed and enchanted a spectacular generation of Brazilian physicists.
After the return of Professor Wataghin to Italy, Dr. Salmeron completed his formal education in physics at the University of Brazil (currently UFRJ) in Rio, and went on to work at the Brazilian Center of Physics Research (CBPF) during 1950.
During his stay at the UnB, Dr. Salmeron lived through a period as fertile in ideas and innovations as it was frustrating.
"It was the most difficult period of my life", he recalls.
During this peregrinate period, Salmeron transformed himself into the rare case of being a professional reference point, of a physicist internationally respected, unifying himself into an ethical and political reference as a professional interested in contributing to research and to an improved standard of teaching, which would inevitably make his country better.
During the long interview that he gave us, he demonstrated his concern with the constant lack of financial structure and the planning of scientific projects that are carried out through international cooperation.
As well, he criticized the lack of major scientific programs that would generate an impact abroad.
-- I'm coming more often to São Paulo, São Carlos, Rio and Brasília, but there are always other things to do in other states.
A few months ago I was in Fortaleza, at a congress and I also have to go to Belém to give a few lectures.
Evidently in France I'm no longer carrying out any experiments.
I stopped after I retired at seventy.
On the physics part I continue to be interested in the interpretation of experimental results carried out on the question on which I worked for fifteen years, namely the search for the plasma of quark-gluon.
Although I'm not doing any experiments, I get to know the results of the work done in Europe and the United States and I'm interested in their interpretations.
But I don't believe it.
-- The plasma problem is complex.
One needs to carry out a collision of the nuclei of two atoms, preferably heavy atoms.
For example, lead against lead or uranium against uranium.
We do this so in order to place the particles into a state of very high energy.
How might we be able to know that this phenomenon exists?
By analyzing the particles that come out after the collision.
There are certain particles that, if the plasma exists, have to be produced with a certain probability and have to come out with certain properties concerning their energy.
Now this is a nuclear process that is extremely complex.
I made up a simple theoretical model through which I demonstrated that certain particles that are characteristic of plasma are also produced with the same properties in classical nuclear processes and they have nothing to do with plasma.
But exactly why don't you believe that your old work group has discovered the quark-gluon particle?
-- Because there is more than one possible interpretation of the phenomenon.
A phenomenon can only be considered new if there is no other possible interpretation.
But ,if it were to be explained by a classical process, well known, then we don't need it.
You carried out this activity of the analysis of experiments in Paris.
When you come here, what do you do?
The Ministry of Science and Technology established a commission to choose the new Director of the CBPF.
Making up the commission are Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz the Unicamp Rector, José Roberto Leite the Director of Scientific and Technological Development at the CNPq, Fernando Zawislak from UFRGS, Marco Antônio Raupp the Director of the National Laboratory for Scientific Computation and myself.
I'm here now because we have four candidates and we are going to interview them.
What other projects are you involved with here in Brazil?
-- I'm doing something that interests me a lot, which is working on teaching.
I'm a retired physicist from the Polytechnic School of Paris, the École Polytechnique, one of the most important in the world and certainly the most important in France, along with the École Normal Supérieure.
I have achieved an agreement between the École Polytechnique and USP for the campuses of São Paulo and São Carlos, and as well for the UFRJ.
Through this agreement, the two Brazilian universities have the right to send graduate students to the Polytechnique.
They will study for two an a half years at the Polytechnique and then receive an engineering degree there.
They will then have two diplomas, one Brazilian and the other French.
It's an excellent idea and at the highest level that exists in the world for graduate courses.
How did you manage to achieve these agreements?
In Latin America it now cooperates with Brazil, Chile and Mexico.
In Asia with China, South Korea and Vietnam...
As I had come from USP and had constant contact as well with the UFRJ, I dealt with making this approximation.
How does the agreement work?
-- Brazilian professors select students of engineering, physics, chemistry, who have shown an interest.
The first criteria is to be good at mathematics.
After the Brazilian selection, there is a commission of professors from the Polytechnique who interview these students.
And once again they select a certain number.
On the 2nd of April of this year I had an immense pleasure because the first group from USP, who went there during 2002, graduated.
There were eleven students from the Polytechnic College of São Paulo, from the Engineering College of São Carlos and from the Physics and Mathematics Institutes of the two Campuses.
There are already two other groups there, each with fourteen students.
This year eleven were selected from USP and three from UFRJ because in Rio only a few candidates came forward.
My objective with this is to contribute to raising the level of teaching at engineering colleges here in Brazil.
Who pays for those who stay in Paris?
-- The Polytechnique.
This is something very fine in France and everyone has the same right, there is no discrimination.
What like was your work at the École Polytechnique of Paris?
-- Sometimes, I had to teach courses on questions related to my work theme, but my main activity was research and to direct research groups.
As well as a physicist I am an engineer.
Someone coming from a humble family background, managing to frequent good public schools, getting to university and making the progress that you have made, so substantial within the university .
-- I had immense luck in my life.
I was a boy when the Spanish civil war began.
I read newspapers every day, and I listened daily to discussions about what was happening.
I have a recollection of that time with my father and uncles; they were against General Franco, against Fascism, and in solidarity with the Spanish republic.
Why did I study engineering?
But during the engineering course I had an excellent teacher of physics at the Polytechnic College who was called Luiz Cintra do Prado.
He was one of the best physics professors that I have seen in my career, within all of the countries that I have lived.
Afterwards when I had graduated, professor Cintra do Prado invited me to be his assistant.
This was what opened up my university career.
I worked as his assistant and at the same time, for a year, once in my lifetime, I worked as an engineer, shortly after having graduated, at the Electro-Technical Institute of USP.
But, since I had a liking for physics, when I was a student at the Polytechnic sometimes I would assist the courses of professor Gleb Wataghin at the Philosophy Faculty.
One day I got to speak to him and from then on I began to work on cosmic rays.
-- Immediately.
I resigned from the Electro-Technical Institute and accepted a scholarship at the College of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, which was a lot less than my previous salary.
Did you know that Professor Wataghin was a delightful man, of extraordinary humanity?
He dealt with everybody equally as Sir or Madam.
The youngest student who would go to talk to him he would call Sir.
In our very first conversation he asked me: "Do you, Sir, realize that as an engineer you could well become a very rich man in your country?".
It was very funny.
In the end, he said enthusiastically: "All right then.
The experiments at the laboratory of professor Wataghin were all done with imported Geiger counters, which very often arrived broken.
He suggested that I should build these counters on a large scale here.
He was very enthusiastic about cosmic rays.
And he told me that in a few years time he was going to go to Europe to work on cosmic rays in the laboratories in the Alps, in a marvelous countryside of snow that didn't exist here in Brazil.
Then he stopped and said: "With physics we don't become rich but we have a lot of fun".
I think that throughout all of my life I was paid to enjoy myself.
Right from that early time until today I have looked at physics with the same pleasure, with the same determination.
-- Not all of them.
All of the others I came to know.
Why did you decide to leave USP and go to Rio de Janeiro?
-- I was the last young Brazilian to be guided by Professor Wataghin.
He stayed at USP for sixteen years and decided to return to Italy.
When he left there was a vacuum at the Philosophy College.
I decided to go to the recently founded CBPF, having received an invitation from Professor Cesar Lattes, and I stayed there for three years.
And why did you leave the CBPF?
-- I was a young man with left wing views and everybody knew it, I didn't hide anything.
I never had any time for it.
And then there was an incident.
We, the CBPF physicists visited the Navy Arsenal in Rio where there were very well mounted physics laboratories.
We were photographed and the photos appeared in the Navy's magazine.
I got to know later that the Rio chief of police telephoned the Admiral saying that I was left wing.
So much so that I never got a grant from the CNPq.
Did you ask for a grant?
-- By chance I ran into Professor Costa Ribeiro, from Rio de Janeiro, who was on the Board of the CNPq.
It was a sign, was it not?
In reality, he was my friend.
It would have been a lot worse to have been refused a grant.
The Admiral was mad at you only because of the photography episode?
-- Isn't it incredible?
Cesar Lattes wanted to get a synchrotron for Rio de Janeiro, identical to that with which he had carried out very important work at Berkeley, when he produced the artificial pi-meson.
So engineers and physicists from Chicago University came down to the CBPF to spend some time in Rio and to project the synchrotron.
At a certain moment, they remained in one of the CBPF buildings.
Admiral Álvaro Alberto gave an order that barred me from entering the building where the Americans had been working.
I though that that was ridiculous and unacceptable and decided to leave.
It would have been something immoral for me myself to have accepted that condition.
Therefore, I decided to resign from the CBPF.
I requested one of them for myself and obtained it.
This was back in 1953.
-- Yes, in cosmic rays.
I chose Manchester because I knew that there they had the most important cosmic ray laboratory in the world.
And I knew that Patrick Blackett, the Director and Professor of the laboratory, a winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, was the authority on the subject.
Afterwards I learned that he was also a great scientific leader, the best science administrator that I have known in my life.
I'll give you an example of the great vision that he had.
During the Second World War, the English enlisted in the armed forces to fight.
This included the universities and naturally the universities became almost empty.
Blackett said: "It's not possible to continue in this manner because the war is going to end some day, so we must think about preparing young people for after the war".
And this happened?
-- Yes.
Many university personnel were recalled but worked in what was called the Civil Defense.
That is to say, when there was bombing they worked as firemen, as assistant nurses, those kind of things.
But the courses never stopped.
When I had written my thesis and was ready to return to Brazil, Professor Blackett called me in and asked if I would like to spend some more time in Europe working at the CERN.
I didn't even know what the CERN was as it had just been established.
He said that it would do me good to spend one or two more years in Europe.
I went off to Geneva, spoke with the CERN Director and ended up being hired for a year.
Then the CERN was just at its beginning.
When I went there were less than ten experimental physicists -- I was one of the first ten experimental physicists contracted by the CERN.
We had absolutely nothing.
How long did you stay there?
-- The idea was to stay a year.
I ended up staying for a second, a third, whereupon they gave me a permanent contract.
I could have retired there if I had so wished.
The first particle accelerator was ready after how long?
-- In less than three and a half years -- a record.
The next one, much larger, on which I worked, took five years.
It was at that time the largest accelerator in the world.
Today a very large proton accelerator, named the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is being built.
In reality what happens is that the protons pass through a series of accelerators before arriving at the LHC.
Is the LHC going to take the place of the Large Electron Position (LEP), the electron accelerator that was deactivated?
-- Exactly.
It's going to be in the same tunnel of 27 kilometers in circumference.
You returned to Brazil directly from the CERN to the UnB.
Who invited you?
-- In truth there was no formal invitation.
Now the person who put together the structure of the UnB was Anísio Teixeira, the greatest educator that Brazil has ever had.
He had long ago thought about a new structure for the old University of Brazil in Rio, today the UFRJ, long before people had been thinking about the UnB.
He wanted to introduce this structure of Institutes and Colleges, which we have today in all Brazilian universities, when the University of Brazil changed its location to the University City on the island called Ilha do Fundão.
But in Brasilia we had begun before.
Before the UnB was this not normal?
-- No, it was not.
The originality of the UnB was the following.
The structure that is today adopted at USP and at the UFRJ, indeed in all universities, began in Brasilia in 1962.
Another very important change with Brasilia was that we changed the structure of the university career.
The lecturer had to pass through the different positions of assistant professor, associate professor and incumbent professor; and in each one of these various steps there were levels for assistant professor No 1, 2 and 3, incumbent 1,2 and 3 and so on.
We were the ones who ended the career structure of chair and assistants.
This was a major innovation.
And in the university reform of 1970 this system was introduced for all of Brazil.
Darcy had worked with Anísio Teixeira, who had then directed the National Institute of Pedagogical Studies (Inep) at the Ministry of education.
It was through Anísio that Darcy learned exactly what made up a university.
Anísio dreamt up and launched the project during the time that the capital city of Brasilia was being built.
Darcy became super enthusiastic and then worked hard for its success.
And when he proposed this idea Darcy agreed with it and began to set up counseling groups.
One day they wrote to me inviting me to participate in one of these groups as an adviser.
I came a number of times from Geneva to attend these discussions.
Everything was going smoothly until the military coup came along.
It was dramatic.
I simply resigned as I thought that I would never be leaving Brazil again.
I began working in Brasilia on the 2nd of January 1964.
And the military takeover occurred on the 31st of March, or better, on the 1st of April.
And then there began a tough time as the university personnel were highly persecuted.
-- Two years, until the end of 1965.
But really it was an extraordinary period because there had been a lot of enthusiasm in Brasilia.
Since Anísio had organized the school system in Brasilia and knew everything about teaching in the city, President Juscelino wanted him as the rector.
But he didn't want that because his family lived in Rio and didn't want to move.
It was then that he suggested that Darcy become the rector.
Anísio would them remain as vice so as to give support to Darcy.
And Darcy, with all his extraordinary energy, had been working like a madman.
President João Goulart ended up liking Darcy so much that he invited him to be the Minister of Education and shortly afterwards, Secretary of State.
Anísio, as he was the vice rector, then became rector.
This was in 1963.
And why wasn't all of this abundant enthusiasm enough to stop all of the 223 professors resigning in 1965?
The idea of resigning had been maturing individually in each of us.
If there was a student discussion in the corridors, the police knew 15 minutes later.
It had reached that point.
Our lectures were taped and given to the police.
We had been working intensely with enthusiasm that I had never seen before in any other place.
The professors and students worked under conditions so difficult and deficient, that sometimes it pained me.
It was a very constructive atmosphere.
Even with the coup?
-- Even after the coup.
All the professors and students were conscious that we had been doing something new.
Therefore in Brasilia the part associated with military persecution was constant.
We had policemen enrolled as students.
It wasn't possible for you to work knowing that the department colleague at your side had been dismissed or taken prisoner, you couldn1t remain at peace.
I had a lot of contact with the military personnel, trying to explain to them what was being done.
Sometimes they invited me to drink coffee in the evening so that they could complain about the university.
This was the environment.
As you can see resignation was inevitable.
Your solution was to return to Geneva?
-- When I resigned, I stayed five or six months unemployed and it was my wife Sonia who sustained the family as a psychoanalyst.
The Director General of the CERN, Victor Weisskopf, knew what had been happening at the UnB.
One day there appeared at home a secretary from the French embassy saying that he had a letter from Professor Weisskopf to give to me personally by hand.
I even kept this letter for three months before deciding to go.
Why?
-- Because I didn't want to leave Brazil.
I even attempted to get work at universities in Rio, Minas Gerais and Bahia, but there was no interest from the rectors, most definitely because of the political climate.
Psychologically this was the most difficult period of my life.
It was very tough.
At the CERN, Professor Weisskopf gave me the same lifetime position that I had had before, which was very high.
So I remained a further year and a half at the CERN.
During this period I also received invitations to go to the universities of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, Columbia, in Nova York State, Trieste, in Italy and to the Polytechnic School of Paris.
We could have remained In Geneva until I would retire.
Life there was very good, my children's education was very high and the university was excellent.
But, after a lot of discussion with my wife, we concluded: "If we had to educate our children outside of Brazil we should go to Paris, because there the children would develop inan intellectual environment unique in the world".
Although the physics in Paris was at the highest international level , we went to Paris because of our children not because of physics.
Physics of a very high level was also present at the CERN.
How do you see present day physics here in Brazil?
-- Physics, like all of the sciences, has progressed considerably in Brazil, especially over the last thirty years.
We have many well-trained physicists who are very competent.
But there are very few groups that make an international impact.
This occurs due to the lack of an infrastructure that allows for three fundamental conditions for scientific research: an authority that defines priorities, and whose decisions are respected; agility so that a decision with respect to a project can be taken in a short period of time; and continuity in the financing of projects.
Brazilian participation in important international projects is also very small, even though we have the people capable of participating in such projects.
There are certain branches of physics that can only be carried out through international cooperation.
Even in rich countries such as the United States, France, England, German, Italy and Switzerland, there are certain branches that not one of them can do on their own.
If a country wanted to do it on its own, when it would be completed the question would already be obsolete, or perhaps it wouldn't reach completion.
International cooperation is indispensable.
Look at two examples, the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina and the Southern Observatory for Astrophysical Research (Soar) in Chile.
These two important projects were approved because there had been decisive participation by FAPESP.
Unfortunately, this rarely occurs in Brazil, because decisions are taken by committees who tend to distribute small allocations of money to various groups and do not have the authority, as FAPESP has, to make decision, to take on responsibility, to assist strongly in the funding of a large project.
There is a lack of infrastructure for international cooperation in Brazil, beginning with the need for a restructuring of financial sources.
When there is international cooperation, the country must assume the responsibility of building the equipment.
This construction may take years and traveling is always necessary to keep in contact with all of the laboratories that are participating.
And in Brazil there is no structure such as this.
Can you give me a concrete example of this lack of structure?
-- I can speak about the specific case of particle physics: if a Brazilian group wanted to work at the CERN there is no structure in Brazil that could finance the equipment and travel.
For each single project there is a fight to obtain financing.
Look at a dramatic case: there are almost one hundred Brazilian physicists who have presented projects to work on four experiments that must be done at the CERN's LHC particle accelerator.
These Brazilian projects were presented some years ago, were approved by the CERN, but have still not been approved in Brazil.
What is happening is that, since for each part of the project there is a time limit and Brazil doesn't make a move, the responsibilities are being passed to other countries.
For example, one of the experiments calls for a large piece of an electromagnet, which is trivial for Brazil to manufacture, with the quality of our industry it could be made even in one of the National Nuclear Energy Commission laboratories.
The Brazilian group proposed, the CERN accepted, and during two to three years nothing happened.
As each piece has to be finished within a certain period, the project was passed to Pakistan.
Brazil has already lost out.
And other projects that Brazilians want to carry out are being passed to other countries.
When Brazil enters into these cooperative projects at the CERN, does it also have to come in with money?
-- It has to come in with equipment, which for us is excellent, its all cutting edge stuff.
The CERN is very large, costs a lot and is financed by twenty countries (the owners of the CERN).
But countries that participate in these experiments, such as Brazil, don't finance the CERN, they participate in the funding of the experiments of which they have a share.
This is different funding, which has nothing to do with the funding of the CERN itself.
In order to evaluate the cost of participation in these experiments, the cost per physicist and per year must be evaluated.
When this calculation is done, one will find that the cost of an experiment carried out by Brazilians in Geneva costs the same as carrying out solid state physics here in São Paulo or in Rio.
There is a very serious lack of information: particle physics is no more expensive than other types of physics.
If we were to make up a team of a Brazilian group with ten physicists this might cost, let's say, US$ 1 million to be spent over a number of years.
Brazil pays for this but almost everything is made in the industries of the country itself.
There has to be part payment in the first year, in the second year, in the third year etc.
This equipment will be used during eight to ten years.
When one adds up how many years it will be used and how many people will be working on it, the cost per person per year is the same as with other projects.
The difficulty is: how can a CNPq committee, with a limited budget, approve a US$ 1 million project if it doesn't have the money?
Therefore a special structure is required from which this financing comes.
And this has to be a national project.
Here there is also a lack of large national projects that mobilize priorities.
There is no clear determination that establishes the line that will be given priority in the budget so as to have international impact.
Lines of research created to produce international impact don't exist here.
But doesn't this only depend on money?
-- No. It depends on money and structure.
Also there is the cultural part: scientists need to accept that this has to be done.
It's not even close to that present in Europe and the United States.
In France, when the government defines a priority evidently with doesn't just fall out of the sky and isn't only done by the authority.
The question is studied by competent people over a period of time, using foreign consultants, and if the idea matures then it becomes a priority.
As soon as it is launched, this priority is accepted by all, nobody protests.
The concern "you have `x' scientists and have a certain amount of money `y', so let's divide `y' by `x' doesn't exist.
And who should have the responsibility for this funding?
-- I believe it should be the federal government together with the country's research foundations.
For example, we have people like Sérgio Rezende, the president of Finep, and José Roberto Leite at the CNPq, who know that there must be an infrastructure and are working to find a solution.
An idea that is being developed is that by way of the sectorial funds, an infrastructure for international collaboration will be built, clearly not only for physics.
What do you yourself believe will be most important for physics in the future?
-- A report was issued some two years ago by a North American committee on this very issue.
The conclusion was that in physics there will be five important fields: particle physics, cosmology, astrophysics, atomic physics and physics in medicine, biology and materials.
Do you, Sir, have faith in science, in education in Brazil...
-- I don't have, no.
Not even when I was a little boy.
So much so that she called me Roberto Aureliano Salmeron because I was born on the day for Saint Aurelian, and my mother and grandmother gave me the name in homage to the Saint.
My father was not religious and I assimilated this without indoctrination.
My mother wanted me to learn the catechism.
I remember that on Sundays I would go off to the Sacred Heart of Jesus school in the district of Campos Elísios in Sao Paulo to assist catechism classes.
An announced revolution
Claudia Izique and Mariluce Moura
A respected researcher in molecular biology, during 1997 one of the mentors, and shortly afterwards one of the coordinators, of the first Brazilian Genome project, that ofXylella fastidiosa , which contributed decisively to change the standards of national research, Reinach is also today a very successful executive in the business world.
He is the Executive Director of Votorantim Ventures, the risk capital fund of the largest national private business group, destined to develop technology based companies, and the Executive-Vice President of Alellyx Applied Genomics, the first of these companies that the fund helped to be born.
At the same time, he had returned contaminated by the entrepreneurial spirit that pushed forward the development of biotechnology in the United States and for this reason started Genomics, the first Brazilian company to carry out paternity tests which began functioning in 2003.
At the beginning of 2004, Reinach was chosen by the magazineScientific American ( American edition) as one of the fifty Business Leaders of 2003, alongside, for example, Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, among other outstanding entrepreneurs throughout the world -- without a doubt a top class distinction.
With this background, he has a privileged vision of the process of change that is occurring in the country, its good points and major obstacles, which he clearly mentions in the following interview:
Can one consider the genome sequencing project ofXylella fastidiosa , from 1998 until 2000, as thewatershed for a new form of producing science in the country?
-- I think so.
But before theXylella something along these lines had already taken place.
The first, up until the decade of the 1970s, was that of the "Colonels" shall we say, the chaired professors.
This picture evolved into another situation, more professional, which coincided with the professionalization of FAPESP itself, not only of the personnel involved but of the very process of funding.
Any person with the correct credentials could approach the Foundation and request assistance.
It was during this period that I began to work at the Foundation, in 1994, with Perez (José Fernando Perez, the Scientific Director).
And it was during this phase that an interesting movement promoted by Rogério Meneghini and Hugo Armelim occurred, whose maxim was the following: whoever carries out research has to publish it.
It became unacceptable not to publish.
The next step was to publish in qualified magazines, in order to produce an impact.
This was a cultural change that occurred firstly in Sao Paulo and only later in the rest of the country.
What you are saying is that a clear understanding took place that for researchers, as well as simply researching, the results of their investigations must be projected to the world outside?
Among traditional professors, the publication of articles was valued, but if one was not to publish that was all right too.
This process of change -- professionalization and formalizing of the support that stimulated publication -- began to open up space for young researchers to carry out what they themselves wanted, independent from the professor.
His blessing was no longer necessary in order to present a project to FAPESP.
A very rigid hierarchal system began to break down.
The research institutes began to hire researchers because they were competent and the result was a greater diversity of themes and more freedom of research.
Thus, a group of relatively young people, independent from their older colleagues, a type of middle class in science, came about.
I am of that generation.
I was hired in Biochemistry and was not an beholding to anyone.
I had not written my doctorate thesis therein, nobody knew me here.
Therefore there was a type of modernization of science and the creation of an independent generation.
Then, while working at FAPESP as a biochemistry coordinator, I realized that a critical mass of people existed who were beginning to get involved with molecular biology and that they were not necessarily aligned to a well known professor.
And this was central for the success of the methodology implanted withXylella , which did not need the blessing of well known full professors.
At this point, had the well know full professors distanced themselves from the new questions that molecular biology placed on the table?
-- We had had classic genetics and from it came molecular biology.
The change was so rapid that one part of the old researchers did not follow it.
That was until large projects such as the atomic bomb or for example huge particle accelerators, began to take place and the problems became of such magnitude that one person alone could not cope.
There then began to be born this concept that certain problems were just too big for one person alone.
In spite of the existence of excellent science having been done by an individual, science carried out by large teams became fashionable.
Perhaps it had its real beginning with the genome projects.
But in Sao Paulo, had not large thematic projects that brought together groups of researchers already been in existence since 1990?
-- That was different.
Scientific cooperation had always existed.
Parallel to the need to attack problems through group work with many people, without which nothing would work, FAPESP also lived through the process of machines becoming more sophisticated and more expensive.
No longer could each one have his own, it was necessary to have collective equipment, as had happened long before with physics and particle accelerators.
It was at this moment that the first genome projects began to come forward and we could verify that our molecular biology had been lagging behind.
Perez then suggested: what we need is a major program to push molecular biology to the forefront.
I had the very correct sensation that we had attained critical mass, the genome projects abroad have taken place in a collaborative manner.
"Listen, in order to give a quantum leap in quality to our molecular biology, why not set up one of them?", we questioned.
Thus, when we proposed the genome project, it was revolutionary.
It met with a large amount of resistance from the old brigade, but they no longer had power over their younger colleagues.
What was the argument from those who resisted?
-- They said that this was work for monkeys, and it wasn't even science.
They affirmed that it was more important that each laboratory have more money to spend than that they work in collaboration.
It was in reality resistance to change.
And we only managed to carry out the project because the young researchers who had managed to come into the system were no longer under the control of the older people.
When the old brigade said "we won't come in", this was very symptomatic of what had been occurring.
Did you have the expectation that the older researchers would join in?
-- I had a bet with Perez, though the details I don't remember well, but which forecast the number of proposals that would be presented.
Our fear was that nobody would sign up for the project.
I said that there would be up to fifty laboratories and he that there would be more than fifty -- Perez won.
And they took a leap forward.
This aspect was revolutionary.
Let's see, I was forty one and probably the oldest.
Andrew Simpson, the project's DNA coordinator, Paulo Arruda and myself were the oldest.
In the old Brazilian scientific scheme they wouldn't have had any space.
-- After we had observed the levels of penetration of national science, we verified that the percentage of Brazilian scientific papers had been increasing in all areas, less in molecular biology that had been evolving more slowly.
Not so much because it was growing so slowly in Brazil, but because it had been growing very rapidly abroad.
At that point, Perez said that we needed to do something.
First there was the idea of carrying out an infrastructure project, purchasing equipment etc.
Instead of giving equipment to everyone, let's set up a project built upon a theme.
For me this was a very strange idea.
I phoned Perez, who was in Santos, and he came up to my country house.
We talked and the idea crystallized.
Why did the idea appear to you so strange?
-- In Brazil a polemic situation has always existed -- and still exists today -- between spontaneous science and induced science.
When a government talks about funding a determined theme, in general the science produced starting from that position is not so good.
This occurs when someone who is not a scientist decides what the scientist has to research.
The opposite to this is when one says: you do what you like and we'll provide the money.
An important example of induced science: After President Kennedy had put a man on the moon, Nixon decided to cure cancer.
This is something rather despotic of administrators.
In Brazil the federal government has always tended to carry out induced science.
I was always against this.
Experience had shown that this never turned out well.
Perez, nevertheless, considered it differently: "We're not saying which genome it will be", he argues.
"This will come fromthepeople themselves."
At the moment when Professor Perez went to your house in Piracaia, you didn't have a clear idea about what the organism to sequence would be?
The genome had to be sufficiently large enough to involve a good number of people and small enough for us to be able to do it with the technology that we had.
At that time I had been working three months per year in the United States, and it was there that I wrote up the first project document at the request of Perez.
I had worked in England with Bob Watterston and John Sulston, who were involved in the human genome.
At this moment there was still no clear idea as to which bacterium would be sequenced?
-- And more, we didn't have a notion about the bacterium.
In the first document there already was the idea that the project would be decentralized, developed at different laboratories, each one sequencing a piece, somewhat in the system of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae .
As well it had also been decided that the strategy would be to work with cosmids and that the microorganism would be from the agricultural area.
A few years previously there had been a discussion at the Brazilian Biochemical Society about the future of biochemistry and there is was stated that the way forward was agriculture, since there was no way that we could compete in the area of cancer.
While this was happening, people at Fundecitrus (the Foundation for the Defense of Citrus Farming) had approached FAPESP with their concern over theXylella .
In September, Joseph Bové, from Bordeaux II University, confirmed that it really was the pathogen of CVC.
-- For me this was very clear.
I had returned to Brazil in 1986 and shortly afterwards João Meidanis and João Setúbal had also returned from the United States.
They came to my laboratory, still at the Chemistry Institute, and said that they needed to do something together.
At that time, myself, Sueli Gomes, from the Chemistry Institute of USP, and Francisco Gorgônio Nóbrega at Univap (the University of the Paraíba Valley), were the only people who had sequenced DNA in Brazil.
I said that I needed a DNA reader, and they made a reader from x-ray film, where the DNA sequencing was done.
And then it went on to press the keys and the device would register A, C, T or G (the letters relating to adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, the bases of the genetic coding).
This was only ten years ago.
When the need for bioinformatics for the genome project came up, I knew that competence existed here.
On the steering committee we had an experienced researcher in bioinformatics, who was Gouffeau, and two Englishmen, Steve Oliver, also a coordinator ofSaccharomyces and John Sgouros.
Oliver came to Brazil, had a meeting at FAPESP and we worked out the details: we needed to have two central laboratories, one bioinformatics and a general coordinator.
At this stage Simpson had already began to get involved in the project.
Perez had also observed that the project would involve a mountain of money, and defended the same idea as Oliver, with the addition that the two laboratories would need to sequence a lot.
So we thought: let's define the positions and people can apply, nobody is going to be pre-chosen.
And the tender came out this way: one opening for a coordinator, two openings for sequencers, one group for bioinformatics and thirty laboratories.
We believed that the coordinator should not be someone linked to FAPESP, because of this problem of the project being induced.
Simpson decided to take on the coordination.
In truth he was the DNA coordinator, and had to guarantee clones.
As there were two central laboratories for sequencing -- mine and that of Paulo Arruda -- and the bioinformatics laboratory, there were in truth four general coordinators for the project.
We carried out the selection process and then called in thesteering committee to make the selection.
There was still a certain amount of resistance: "Goodness, but they don't have a research project.
I'm only going to be a candidate to sequence a piece of DNA".
The criticisms had already begun.
Thus it was decided: of the thirty laboratories, ten would have to be run by people who knew a little bit about sequencing.
A further ten with researchers coming from agriculture, who knew nothing about sequencing, but had an idea about this bacterium, theXylella .
And ten had to be made up of people who were not in agriculture, who knew nothing about sequencing, but were scientifically competent and who wanted to learn.
The profile, for example, of José Eduardo Krieger.
At this moment, at the beginning of 1998, were you all ready to begin the work?
At that time they had still not closed down the Koch postulation concerningXylella (which demonstrates the cause of an disease).
Or better, it had not been closed for isolated Brazilians samples.
Joseph Bové had taken the samples to France and closed the Koch postulate there.
We decided to do it with the French one.
My fear was that people had mixed the bacteria and we would end up with the wrong bacterium.
Does this technology continue to be used?
Do you make use of these procedures at Alellyx?
-- TheXylella was done using cosmid.
Well, the two laboratories, mine and that of Paulo Arruda, had sequenced considerably and lots of interesting things happened.
Paulo Arruda assumed the role of educator: he organized the courses, brought the people from the laboratories to teach them how to sequence.
As my laboratory was different, we decided that we were going to get people from abroad and bring to Brazil the most advanced technology.
It's very interesting to note that things happen because of the determination of people.
Another funny moment was the arrival of the sequencing machines on Christmas day or New Year's Eve, I don't remember well.
-- When we managed to have our results published inNature , it had a lot of influence on the self-esteem of people in any branch of science.
Did the degree of ambition of Brazilian research change levels starting from theXylella ?
-- It changed.
They were two bacteria, each double the size ofXylella , and were done with a quarter of the personnel, a quarter of the budget and half the time.
-- But theXanthomonas project was the last specifically genome project.
I always criticized the fact that we called it the genome project, since it is not exactly a genome project, that is, the sugarcane, bovine etc.
Please, can you explain this distinction from the scientific point of view?
The others are projects on the sequencing of the messenger RNA, only the expressive part of the genome.
n But isn't everything under the umbrella of genomics?
-- Of genomics, yes.
But they are not genome projects.
That is not to say that they are better or worse, just that they are different.
The first to carry the name and which was not about a genome was the cancer project, a type of madness, as cancer doesn't have a genome, who has the genome is the human being.
The sugarcane and the eucalyptus projects are EST projects.
But I believe that, when it was decided to do them, there was a slight loss of the impetus that there had been at the start, as the challenges became lesser.
We have been repeating a little bit, which makes criticizing much easier.
But then came other large and important projects such as the Biota.
-- Standards rose.
The circle had to be closed: in the same manner that the human genome is transforming the American pharmaceutical industry, we, who sequenced theXylella , have to resolve theXylella problem, transforming science into wealth.
For me this was the challenge: the next step was outside of the academic world, whilst inside the academic world one needs to remain daring.
It was there that we lost the rhythm, the impetus, and we began to receive criticism.
Doesn't research into the proteome represent the next step in the academic world?
-- Genome projects are absolutely measurable.
The final product is finite, measurable and known.
EST projects do not have this: the time comes when one have to stop.
The great thing about theXylella project was: either you finished or you didn't finish.
And its completely obvious.
This is more or less classical research, there is no exact answer, in that we are trying to understand how the world works.
And this is natural, it's the process of science.
After all, large cooperation projects work well when the objective is very clear.
Everybody who enters knows: you get there to the point or you don't get there.
The times when there are scientific projects in the world in which the final objective is very clear are rare.
-- I'm not so close to what people are doing today, but I believe that it returned to being classical.
But I don't even know if having one of these projects for molecular biology at the moment would be suitable, this is not the normal way of operating science, and not always does one find projects like these.
And it's not possible in these cases to assert the objective and say, OK let's all do this.
These objectives can appear spontaneously or are they always induced?
It so happens that in FAPESP the scientific community is within, different from what happens at the CNPq.
Thus, FAPESP captured the voices of the community and catalyzed the process.
Let's move on a little into the private sector.
It would appear to us that one of the changes in the Brazilian standard of producing science was that it increased, after the second half of the 1990's, the possibility of research in businest.
-- There are various reasons for this.
During the dictatorship the university was the center of resistance and wanted to distance itself from the private sector.
Another point is that the perception that one has of science is changing.
Everyone talks about it creating wealth and in the United States, for example, this is true.
Scientific development that generates new technologies, generates new companies, generates taxes, jobs and wealth for a country and this wealth return to the university.
This is the virtuous cycle of investment in S&T.
In Brazil this cycle is beginning to close.
It had not closed due to a number of things.
At the start it didn't have the scientists.
Until the decade of the 70's there wasn't critical mass.
Afterwards it began to gain critical mass, but the scientists didn't want to know about the private sector.
When democracy returned, there was critical mass, but there was a reserved market, and there was no demand from companies.
Brazil was closed.
Then the country was opened up.
Now we have critical mass and things are beginning to flow.
In order to close the cycle we need capital, which has begun to appear over the last five or six years.
Did theXylella project, as well as its significance for molecular biology, signal a moment of change for other sectors of society?
-- The private sector doesn't know what's happening at the universities.
TheXylella project, as it had international projection, signaled that Brazilian scientists had competence.
There were lots of things happening but they were not obvious.
At the time when they came out inNature , inThe Economist , the first plant genome, then is was confirmed that the science business was working.
It has to be visible and call the attention.
This was not the first evidence that science was competent.
Indeed, it was exactly because science was competent that theXylella project came about.
For the private sector this meant that it was possible to invest in the university and that this could be used to develop technology for companies.
But when the result of the Xylella project came out, here in Sao Paulo innovation technology programs such as PITE and PIPE had already been in existence since 1995...
-- Clearly in the academic world there had been the recognition of the need for integration with the private sector.
This didn't exist and still doesn't directly exist.
And this is beginning to happen or not?
If I live in Switzerland, a peaceful country, and jump using a parachute, I'm doing something that is super dangerous.
I have a life with low risk and my real risk is practicing a extreme sport.
But, if I live in Brazil, to leave your house in the morning and not getting assaulted or knocked down is already a risk.
Why should I run the risk of parachute jumping as well?
The problem with our national industry is the same thing.
Brazil doesn't have political stability, doesn't have a regulations system and has instability of so many natures that the company, which is already taking a number of risks, fears taking on the risk of developing new technologies.
It's too risky.
Businesspersons -- unless they receive lots of pressure -- prefer not to invest.
When one says that the Brazilian entrepreneur does not want to run risks, this is not fair.
Perhaps he'll not run the risk that we, the scientists, would like him to run, which is to invest in new technology.
Doesn't the fact that you're linked to the largest Brazilian private group and are President of a technology based company, not run opposite to what you've just been saying?
-- This process is in its infancy and it's natural that it should begin in a group that can afford the luxury of running risks.
In the United States, groups that are a lot less solid run this technology risk.
Concern with innovation is secondary.
Within these risks that in the Brazilian environment appear to be greater, where does the question of patents fit in?
-- For example, plant molecular biology leads automatically to genetically modified agriculture.
Let's consider three companies that want to develop transgenic plants: one in Europe, one in the United States and the third on Brazil.
Europe doesn't accept transgenics, the rules are known and everyone knows that you can't.
In the United States the rules are known and the production and commercialization of transgenics is allowed.
In Brazil, one doesn't know if one can or one cannot.
The regulation is not defined, everything is stopped in the justice system, the bill for bio-security is with the government and nobody knows if it will be approved.
But this has nothing to do with technological development, but more with the economic environment?
-- But these are the things that determine scientific development.
One doesn't know if the Judiciary System will approve one's patent.
But doesn't the Patents Law in Brazil exist?
Is this law not regulated?
--One thing is to have a law legally approved, another is to comply with that law in practice.
Look at the case of Monsanto with transgenic soya in Argentina, which has a patents law.
The farmer plants the soya and doesn't pay the due royalties.
The company goes to court to fine the offender.
The court doesn't apply a fine, and the other doesn't pay.
It's the same thing as buying a ranch in the Pontal do Paranapanema.
The land is cheap but it's risky: the landless group could well invade.
You don't just need a law but you have to have the apparatus in place that guarantees that it will be discharged.
What are your bets on the development of biotechnology within the entrepreneurial field?
-- The ideal is to bet on things that, if it's not possible to sell here in Brazil, you can sell abroad, as in the case of human and agricultural biotechnology.
But what you people are doing here today is it not more feasible for the national market?
-- it's feasible for any market.
A good example is Embraer's technology that is global.
If the Brazilian assembly plant were to be closed, the plane could be produced in Venezuela.
People tend to invest in things that minimize the risk of the country where they are.
If Embraer were to be manufacturing a plane that could only be made here in Brazil, that would be very risky.
But when one researches the agent for causing sudden plant death, you're thinking on a Brazilian problem?...
-- This is really one of Alellyx's problems.
Alternatives for learning
Marcos de Oliveira and Neldson Marcolin
He is also a successful example of migration from the classroom to private enterprise.
An electronic engineer by training, before venturing into the risky world of business, he became a professor at the Physics Institute of the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), when he came back to Brazil after spending a few years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and as a researcher with the Bell Laboratories of the American company AT&T (nowadays Lucent), in the United States.
This experience as a researcher, professor, development director of an electronic manufacturer, and, finally, a successful businessman, has led Ripper to be invited to take a seat on the board of several entities linked to the sector, including Unicamp.
The owner of a broad vision about some of the main Brazilian themes connected with universities and, above all, with the production of innovation and research and development in companies, the businessman has opinions that go far beyond common sense both on Brazilian universities and on innovation.
In this interview, he tells a little about his ideas and talks of his education at the Aeronautic Institute of Technology (ITA), where his study group constructed the forerunner of the first Brazilian computer, as an end of course task.
We would like to know your opinion about the proposal from Professors José Fernando Perez and Fernando Reinach, presented at the National Science and Technology Council (CNTC), of which you are part, about taking the tax burden off companies that contract doctors, as a way of encouraging business innovation.
-- I think it is useful, but relatively collateral.
Any incentive for companies is good.
But a doctor's education is for academic research.
In a company, development is done.
This doesn't mean that a doctor is no use.
In AsGa, do you employ doctors?
How many are there?
But, actually, Brazilian companies don't have the size to do research.
And the way for doing development is different from the way for doing research.
Which does not mean to say that a good researcher does not adapt himself and be very useful.
But the idea that you need to have a doctor in companies is not the reality.
Now, I'll certainly give all my support to any incentive that comes for companies.
It just happens that it is not for the lack of doctors that companies are not doing research.
Why are they not doing it?
-- First, nobody knows how much is done.
All the figures are absolute guesswork.
There are no statistics in Brazil in this area.
What data is there?
I don't even know how this one is done.
There's the questionnaire of the National Association for Research, Development and Engineering of Innovative Companies (ANPEI), which goes to some companies.
What happens to this questionnaire?
First, a large number do not answer.
What happens, for example, with AsGa?
I pick up this questionnaire and I send it to my accountant.
If you ask exactly how much I spend on research and development (R&D), I don't know.
But it isn't the best way.
Is it a different way of accounting?
-- The Law on Information Technology considers that investment in a quality system and in human resources is an investment in R&D.
The majority of companies in Brazil have no incentive to do this.
Rather, a law has now been regulated allowing R&D to be considered as an expense and deducted for accounting purposes.
But what do they do?
Development?
-- They do development, things that would be regarded as R&D, but are of no interest to the companies.
They make a new product, a new production technology.
It is clearly very difficult for a company, even a large one, to come and to say "I am going to do something that will perhaps bring a result ten years from now".
What is done in companies is product development.
To do this, it is not necessarily required to have a professional Ph.D.
Now, the professional who is heading up development just has a graduate's degree.
And he is exceptional, one of the best professionals doing development in the country, but he doesn't have an academic curriculum, he doesn't have a doctorate, he doesn't have any work published.
Isn't doing innovation in companies one of the ways out for the country's economy?
-- But of course.
I think that the people from the university do not understand what industrial development is.
What is the product of the university?
People.
Research at the university is a means, not an end.
Only in the technological area?
-- In any area.
Everything evolves.
Knowledge is something ongoing, and they will have to carry on with this process.
I had an example of this at Unicamp, as soon as I came back to Brazil.
Was this at the beginning of the 1970s, when you returned from your master's degree and doctorate at the MIT and from the work at the Bell Labs?
-- Precisely, I came back from the United States in 1971.
Soon afterwards, the Brazilian Physics Society decided to carry out a study about Brazilian physicists and contracted an opinion poll company.
A woman came to interview me with a standard questionnaire.
One, "was the education for graduation important in your professional life?".
For this, there were options for a reply like "a lot", more or less", and I put "a lot".
The second question was: "Were the disciplines of your undergraduate course important in your professional life?"
On this one, I put the lowest mark, "it was not important".
Now, I had an extremely sound education as an undergraduate in electrical engineering at ITA and as a postgraduate student at the MIT.
Then you migrated to physics?
-- Actually, I never decided to be a physicist.
I went to work in a laboratory of Bell Labs.
There, a Brazilian group settled in the United States, which was more or less informally linked together and had Rogério [Rogério Cezar Cerqueira Leite] as a sort of leader, wanted to go back to Brazil.
This began in 1970.
"Let's go to the University of Brasilia", he said.
He asked: "Why not?
It's a new mentality, it's formidable".
I replied: "Rogério, the UnB is too close to the lion's den".
A few days went by, the telephone rang at home at 6 in the morning.
It was Rogério: "Have you read today's paper?
You were right".
[in 1968, police invasions occurred, and there was a serious institutional crisis at the university.]
Besides Professor Rogério and you, who else was part of this group?
-- Sérgio Porto, Paulo Sakanaka and Nélson Parada.
Why did they decide to go back?
-- I have already asked myself this question several times, and I have a reply that is very easy to give aposteriori , like everything in life.
There is an American expression that talks about a big fish in a small pond, a small fish in a big pond.
I was at Bell Labs at the time -- and just in the building where I worked, which was not the same as Rogério's, there were 1,500 Ph.Ds.
You were just one more.
-- If one more Nobel Prize came out of Bell, it wouldn't make the least difference.
I thought: "The day I leave, the feeling I have is that the cleaning lady is going to notice that the trash can is empty".
I think that Brazil used to offer, as it certainly has offered, an opportunity for making a difference.
I don't know if it was good or bad, but plenty would not have happened, had I not done it personally, if Rogério hadn't done it personally.
Not that we were less or more important, it's because there weren't any others.
This gave us a very great professional motivation.
How was the beginning at Unicamp?
If I had not come to Unicamp, perhaps I would never have taken up the position of a physicist.
-- Not much, no, I didn't.
The talk had three titles.
The first was: "How to make the right decisions for the wrong reasons".
The second: "How to let life take decisions for you".
And the third: "How to become a businessman by chance".
Analyzing the main professional decisions that I have taken in my life, they worked out all right not for the reasons why I took the decision.
Less than a year before joining ITA, I had never heard of ITA.
Were you living in Rio de Janeiro?
-- Yes, I was living in Rio.
I think that the main reason why I went to ITA was that I wanted to leave home, I wanted to be independent.
But that is to look at it aposteriori .
I chose electronics because I didn't want aeronautics, the only two options in those days.
It was certainly one of the most important decisions in my life.
Afterwards, the institution became a good engineering school because it had good students, independently of the professors.
-- In 1964 it coincided with the departure of Air Marshall Casimiro Montenegro Filho [who conceived the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA) and ITA] who was about to retire.
So those on the highest level left.
In six months, 22 out of 25 had left.
And the institute never recovered.
But what makes a good school are the pupils, the professors are a nuisance.
Isn't it the other way round?
-- No, it's true.
This is an opinion that shocks everybody.
I consider that the most important thing in my professional education is called the Santos Dumont Academic Center.
More important than the doctorate at the MIT.
-- Because the academic center at ITA -- and this was destroyed by the 1964 revolution -- used to be the heart of the institution.
When I arrived there, I asked: "Where do they need people?"
They said: "There on the radio".
The students had invented and set up a radio station, building a good deal of the equipment.
I had just turned 18 and went to São Paulo, from recording company to recording company, to get discs donated.
Later on, I was president of the Athletic Club and had to manage a budget.
Was it a question of a creative process as well?
-- There was the creative process and the cultural one.
Every Monday, we had a first class play or a concert.
That's important at the beginning of the students' lives.
Furthermore, there was the exhausting course.
The pass mark was at least 6.5, between 5 and 6.5 in any subject you had to do the exam again, and below 5 you were dismissed.
This second part has been maintained.
I never said this to speak badly about the professors, I have always said that ITA's role belongs to the pupils.
Including this kind of analysis connected with my work at Unicamp, where I am on the University Council today.
Incidentally, I have a profession and a hobby.
I am at Unicamp, on the National Science and Technology Council, at the Telecommunications Research and Development Center (CPqD), at the Renato Archer Research Center (Cenpra), on the advisory council of the Financier of Studies and Projects (Finep), and on the scientific council of Uniemp Institute.
Up until a month ago, I was with the Committee for Postgraduate Courses in Higher Education (Capes).
You said that the group that was in the United States came to Unicamp.
How was this done?
-- It was all in the head of Zeferino [Zeferino Vaz, the creator of Unicamp].
To start with, he had difficulties in attracting top level personnel to Unicamp.
It was all more or less certain that we would go to USP, but resistances from the inside began there, and we came to Unicamp.
Zeferino realized that the arrival of a high level group would help to attract people from other areas.
But he already also had the idea of the university as the center of a complex for the city of Campinas, and that made us enthusiastic.
He helped us, and I recall that, a few years later, when I was the director of the physics department, he heard that in Brasilia they were analyzing the decision on the place to set up the CPqD, and that Campinas was in second place on the list.
What was the first?
-- It was São José dos Campos.
So I went to Zeferino and said: "This is what is happening, and you must get involved, it's time to talk to José Antônio de Alencastro e Silva", who was the president of Telebrás.
That very moment, he called Alencastro, inviting him to visit Unicamp.
When he came out of it, the CPqD belonged to Campinas.
Did Unicamp already have this relationship with Telebrás?
Telebrás decided to come in afterwards.
Telebrás's first president, Euclides Quandt de Oliveira, who afterwards was a minister, when this state sector was created, right at the end of 1972, realized that if he created the CPqD (founded in 1976) immediately, it would not work out.
It was the university that was carrying out research in telecommunications, and as he couldn't kill the hen that was laying the golden eggs So Telebrás postponed the creation of this center, and the money it would have spent was invested in projects in the universities to create critical mass.
And one of the first projects approved was with Unicamp, in the group that I was running, for the development of optical fiber communication.
Years later, I met Quandt de Oliveira at an airport.
"So why did you approve that project?"
He replied: "They said that you would form good people, that is what we were interested in".
When did you do Zezinho ( Joey), the first computer project in Brazil?
-- That was in 1961.
At ITA, the pupil has to do a project in his last year, which can be done in a group.
In the vacations between the fourth and fifth years, I did a trip to Europe with four colleagues and two professors from ITA.
I was in France, visiting some institutions, amongst them the state sector Companie des Machines Bull, which the French government had created.
There they presented a few computers to us.
"If the French can do it, why can't we?
Let's make a computer", we said soon afterwards.
We changed the focus of the project to make something for laboratory use.
Who was in this group?
Nobody thought about that, none of us had any idea that that could be something pioneering.
Different from the Ugly Duckling (regarded as the first Brazilian computer, finalized at USP in 1972)?
-- Yes, but the Ugly Duckling was made under another scheme, almost a decade afterwards, with conscious investment in the area.
Besides more resources, it was now included in a process.
What was the name Zezinho for?
-- It was never the formal name.
It was its pet name.
It was a didactic computer, transistorized.
When the end of the year came, it became a point of honor to leave it working.
We worked at the weekends, at Christmas, and even after graduation.
It seems that, two years later, another student -- I was then in the United States -- took Zezinho as an individual work, to carry out a series of improvements, but afterwards I think it was cannibalized.
How did you go to the MIT?
-- I won a scholarship from the foundation of GE (General Electric).
GE's foundation would give ten scholarships for ten countries.
I never studied so much as in those days in the United States.
As I started to do well in the studies, they began to press me to do a doctorate.
Drawn in by that atmosphere, I rang my wife, in November, and proposed: "Do you fancy getting married at Christmas?"
Then I wrote to my mother, saying that if she gave me a ticket as a wedding present, I would get married in Brazil, otherwise I would marry by proxy.
I think I should be in the Guinness book.
I took my master's and doctor's degrees in four years.
I began unmarried and finished with three children.
Afterwards, I went to work with Bell Labs, where I stayed five years.
Was that where you got to know optical fiber?
In 1970, two fundamental developments occurred: first, the group from Bell in which I was taking part managed to make a semiconductor laser that worked at room temperature.
Before, it would have to be cooled down to a low temperature for it to work.
And the second, Corning Glass announced the first optical fiber produced in the laboratory.
But this would take a long time yet to become economically important.
After I returned to Brazil, I began to sell the idea of starting a program in this area, for us to arrive together with the others, because we had time and could train people.
Meaning: development here in Brazil was much less backward in this area than usually happens?
-- Our laboratory at Unicamp was the third in the world to make the second generation of this kind of laser, before Bell Labs.
Well, it could be a question of asking why they did it before.
If I want to make fun, I say "I had two students who didn't know that it was difficult".
But in reality how does this happen?
-- As the university's product is people, it has a great advantage: abandoning a project practically without any trauma.
The same thing doesn't happen in a company's research center, for example, where many decisions are needed to start a project, and stopping it becomes a traumatic process.
How did you give up the university and become a businessman?
-- That's one of the many right decisions made for the wrong reasons.
So I began to distance myself, little by little, from my laboratory at Unicamp.
When the project was finally approved, political injunctions occurred and they decided to appoint another person to run it.
Then I saw myself stranded without the ladder.
Psychologically, I had already left the university, and it was very difficult to get back to being motivated, besides which I had passed on my position as head to another colleague.
In this case, I had to decide whether to change profession or change country.
With the family settled, I decided to change profession.
Where did you start?
- My idea was to go to the area of microelectronics.
I was in this process when the president of Elebra invited me to run the company's development area.
I did though tell him that I didn't understand anything about electronics, nor about computers, and nothing about industrial development.
So his reply made me enthusiastic: "We know that.
We arrived at the conclusion that nobody in Brazil had ever done the development we wanted to do.
And if we brought someone from abroad to work here, he's not going to understand either".
I said, if that was the concept, then I would accept.
That was in 1983.
What did Elebra produce in those days?
-- Telecommunication equipment, computer peripherals, printers, discs.
But at the end of the Cruzado Plan (Econimic Plan in the mid-80´s that froze prices), Elebra was deep in debt.
They decided to get rid of the microelectronics area and asked me if I believed in the project.
I said that I did, and they asked me to get some partners.
After a lot of legwork, I went to the wedding of a daughter of a colleague in São Paulo.
I replied that unless I had at least US$ 1 million, there was no way we could talk.
Then he said: "Don't you want to negotiate with me?"
That was how AsGa was born.
Who was the partner?
-- João MacDowell.
He had an auto parts factory.
An aunt of mine decided to make an advance on an inheritance, and we were able to make AsGa.
He was very important, not only for the funds, but because he had experience in running a company.
Afterwards, later, he decided to sell his part in the business.
AsGa was born to make what?
They are things that go onto the end of an optical fiber.
The name AsGa comes from gallium arsenide, a compound used a raw material for semiconductors and lasers.
At the time, our dream was to evolve into making semiconductors.
Because we didn't lose out to imported components, we lost out to imported equipment.
It became cheaper to import a kit for assembling the equipment here.
So we began to migrate to making equipment.
How was the change?
-- We almost went bankrupt, but we had a project with the BNDES that was approved.
They invested US$ 1 million in AsGa.
Half in stock and half in a loan.
And then we managed to survive and to grow once again on the basis of multiplexers, which do the transmission of several electrical or light signals at the same time.
You almost reached the R$ 100 million mark in sales.
-- With the rule on targets that made the telecommunication companies bring forward their investments, there was a huge bubble between mid-2000 and mid-2001.
Everybody knew that was a bubble, only the fall was more violent than was expected when it burst, because the world-wide telecommunications market was slumping, and this caused a deeper crisis.
We fell from R$ 90 million in sales in 2001 to R$ 27 million in 2002, an amount repeated in 2003.
But this time we were much more prepared.
And the question of the Law on Innovation, of the famous supposition that a university professor is going to be able to leave and set up his company, work in the industry and to carry on with a certain link with the university.
What do you think about this?
-- I think that the Law on Innovation, besides bringing some very good things, may correct some others.
For example, today, a Brazilian government body cannot contract a company to develop a product.
Under the current law, the government can only lend money to companies, it cannot do anything more.
If, for example, the government wants to have a product that AsGa is going to have to develop, it can't contract me to carry out this development.
No Embraer would be possible today.
Is that the so-called purchasing power of the government?
-- No, it's not for purchasing, it's for development.
In the United States, the government spends, hiring development in companies, twice what it spends on research in the universities.
This is the main instrument of development in the developed countries, and it is allowed by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
And the work of a professor?
-- In all the countries of the world, providing consultancy is part of a professor's work.
Consultancy is the way the university understands the society for which it is training people.
There's no point in keeping the professors locked up in the university.
When I was at Unicamp, do you know who the best remunerated professors were?
The ones from the music department.
Because they would play music outside?
-- Because under the legislation of those days, the only thing you could earn outside was copyright.
Except that it allowed the fee as copyright.
So the musicians earned the same thing I would earn as a professor, besides the fee.
Are you going to want a music pupil to follow the teachings of someone who has never in his life presented himself at a concert?
I am not defending the case of the professor who works half time at the university and half time outside.
That's not good.
He is more at one and less at the other.
But if he goes outside and it doesn't work out, he comes back with an increase in knowledge.
In the United States, you cannot charge less than so much an hour, so as not to demoralize the university.
You have manifested yourself contrary to the expression "unlimited funds".
-- I hate this term.
If you give money for the university to do research, for the public good, it cannot be with unlimited funds.
It's an investment.
In the United States, any government agency that has a contract with a large company has to set aside, I think it is 2% or 2.5% of its budget, for micro and small businesses.
If Nasa contracts a large company to make a space shuttle, it has to arrange for contracts with small companies for 2.5% of the cost of that vehicle.
It's not financing, it's a development contract.
And it's not money being given, results have to be shown.
This goes for universities, and it goes for companies.
The medicine radical
Marcos Pivetta and Ricardo Zorzetto
Nobody remains indifferent to the presence of pharmacologist Gilberto De Nucci.
Tall, corpulent, and fast walking, De Nucci is the owner of a grave voice and goodhearted look that help him to make friends with almost the same ease that he picks up enemies.
It is because this 46-year-old doctor has opinions as sturdy as they are polemical, and is not afraid of saying what he thinks.
"At least two thirds of medicaments do not produce the desired effect", he asserts.
To put it more plainly, they have an action that is more psychological than pharmacological.
Nucci is currently developing three medicaments.
The first to reach the market -- possibly as early as 2005 -- is lilafil, intended to treat difficulty in keeping up an erection.
Produced by him for the Brazilian laboratory Cristália, lilafil's molecule is similar to Viagra's, and began to be tested on human beings in August.
The researcher is also working on synthesizing an anti-inflammatory and a new class of antihypertensives.
If his ideas are controversial, his competence is undeniable: De Nucci is one of the country's most productive researchers.
Today, he is still one of the three most influential Brazilian researchers, whose works appear amongst those most cited by other studies, according to a survey of the ISI Highly Cited database, which includes the 4,800 most influential researchers of a total of 5 million scientists.
De Nucci has now registered 22 patents with the National Institute of Industrial Property and 8 with the World Intellectual Property Organization.
He has also been the target of 12 legal, administrative, or ethical proceedings.
"Later on, I won the fight in the State ofSãoPaulo Regional Medicine Council", he says.
Educated at the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, of the University of São Paulo (USP), he went to study pharmacology in England, through a personal identification with one of his professors, the pharmacologist Sergio Henrique Ferreira.
As if that were not enough, two years ago he opened his own research laboratory in Campinas: the Galeno, where bioequivalence tests are carried out on medicaments and the analysis of toxic substances in chicken and crustaceans intended for export.
A few months ago, you declared in an interview that 80% of the medicines did not work.
Could you explain this question better?
Or there is no scientific evidence that they work, since it is not possible to assess their action against a series of pathologies.
In this case, the effect of the medicament depends on several factors, such as the kind of stroke and the area affected.
As there is no way of knowing what the behavior and the memory used to be like before the problem, it is difficult to know if the medicine is assisting the recovery.
The medicine is given in the belief that the person is going to improve, but there is no certainty.
After all, we do not know how this pathology arises.
We know how it evolves, and to measure whether the evolution is for better or worse with the medicine is complex.
There is no evidence that the medicine works against the disease.
Actually, in this case, it's not even necessary.
It isn't necessary?
-- In the case of Alzheimer's disease, there is an accumulation of certain proteins, it is enough to show that the medicament reduces this accumulation [for it to be regarded as useful].
Sometimes, it is not even known whether the problem is really important for the appearance of the disease.
But, as there is no way of discovering this, it is better to put the drug onto the market and see what happens.
When one does not know whether a medicine works, it's because we do not yet have means for verifying this.
But don't you have to know that the medicine at least does no harm, before prescribing it?
-- Supposedly.
Clinical tests are done to find out whether the medicine, a priori, does no harm.
Now this doesn't mean to say that undesired effects will not arise, when it is administered to human beings.
This risk is accepted.
And people prescribe them even so.
He says that the wish to take medicines is perhaps the main characteristic that differentiates the human being from other animals.
But there are medicines that work, the action of which extrapolates the placebo effect.
This makes everyone happy: the patient, who buys the medicine, and the doctor, because clinical studies show that the effect of the medicine is highly significant.
One example is the use of aspirin in the prevention of heart attacks.
Several studies show that, in the right dose, aspirin reduces almost threefold a recurrence of the problem.
-- The whole logic of the system is aimed precisely for medicines to be taken.
I'm not saying that medicines are not effective.
But the best clinical studies show that, for 90% of the population, medicines do not bring any benefit, or that there rarely is a benefit.
This doesn't mean that medicines are of no use, but that the percentage of patients who benefit is very small, sometimes 2% or 3%.
An example?
A medicine known for treating diabetes, acarbose, which is not absorbed by the organism and competes with the absorption of sugar.
The medicine does not alter the evolution of the disease.
In theory, physicians accompany specific publications in their area and have to be updated, to know what is effective before giving it to the patient, don't they?
-- Actually, no.
Medical assessment is subjective, in spite of people having the fantasy that physicians display a scientific attitude.
History shows that they don't.
But aren't you a physician?
-- I'm a physician.
Do you mean to say that doctors make a diagnosis and prescribe merely on the basis of the results that they see in their offices?
-- It's difficult to apply the scientific methods used in the laboratory in the practice of medicine.
At congresses, you see a lot of conduct based on subjective criteria, the physicians saying "how I treat it, how I do it".
The conducts of evidence based medicine are defined following meta-analyses: you bring together the works about the positive and negative effects of a drug.
But, as one knows, the probability of studies with favorable results is greater than for works with unfavorable results.
This contaminates the conclusions derived from the meta-analyses, hence the expression evidence biased medicine.
Abroad, there is an increasingly intense debate about the obligatoriness of pharmaceutical companies making public all their results, including the bad ones.
-- There's a muddle here.
Making data public doesn't imply publicizing them in a scientific publication.
The laboratories have to inform the results of all their researches, whether they are favorable or not, to the regulatory body, which then decides to authorize the sale of the medicine or not.
Isn't it too little?
The physician who prescribes a medicine would then be able to see this data.
The regulatory body does a review of the clinical study, because it is there that the raw data is.
But in people's imagination, the pharmaceutical industry is a bad boy, it's people who want to earn money.
In Italy, 4,000 doctors were recently prosecuted for this.
-- I'm not sanctifying...
Isn't the current working model of the pharmaceutical industry inefficient?
The laboratories say that developing a drug can cost US$ 800 million, because hundreds of molecules have to be created before it becomes a commercial product.
Is it right to maintain this model?
-- It's the capitalist model.
The pharmaceutical industry aims profits, and its products have high added value.
It only does not charge more because people can't pay.
It's the logic of the market.
-- Exactly.
Why is the daily rate of a leading private hospital much more expensive than the rate of another one, without such a good reputation?
Without going into the question of price, the fact is that there are good medicines, which help medicine advance.
The rest doesn't matter much.
The clinical procedures, talking to the patient, they don't matter?
-- Nonsense.
It's medicines that really make the difference.
Perhaps the price is absurd, but they mean great advances.
Besides these medicines, there's an enormous range whose value is dubious, the assessment is complex, or the prescription unsuitable.
But one third is effective.
In actual fact, there are doubts even so.
With other models, perhaps they wouldn't have to be effective.
In Britain and in the United States, some antidepressives are being accused of inducing to suicide, and there are those who say that the pharmaceutical industry hid some data about its products.
How should a public body that takes care of the quality of the medicines proceed in these cases?
-- The fundamental concern of the body is not that the medicine works -- I think they have even lost hope of this --, but that it doesn't do any harm.
For American culture, whether a drug works is an open question.
But when it is proved to be harmful, the regulatory body becomes jointly responsible, alongside the pharmaceutical industry.
So there is indeed a concern with the safety of the medicine.
Aren't people taking more medicine than necessary?
-- Yes, but as I said, there is a placebo effect.
This does not mean that this effect is not a good one.
Look at the case of the antihistamines.
If a person is stung by a mosquito and has an itch, you say: "Take the medicine straight away, or it won't have an effect".
The itching passes before the medicament is absorbed, the medicineis lost.
This is complex.
There is this notion that medicine is something good, but, when the evidence is sought, few classes of drugs are effective.
Could you give some examples of really effective drugs?
-- When I was a medical student, duodenal ulcer surgery was frequent.
Today, you take Tagamet (cimetidine) or Antak (ranitidine -- Zantac), and the ulcer heals in three weeks.
Nobody knows how to operate ulcers any more, it's very rare.
Moreover, surgery was never a medical specialty.
It arose in the 19th century and should disappear in the 21st century.
Do you think that specialization in surgery has its years numbered?
-- Surgeries have almost ended in some specialties, since there has been a drastic reduction in the number of procedures.
Cancer surgery still exists, but may be abandoned in due course.
Today, a prostate tumor is treated with heat, radiotherapy or medicaments.
Except for the esthetic area, surgery is something not very sophisticated.
Isn't it cheaper than abroad?
-- With US$ 5 million, you can get a me-too [a copy of an existing medicine].
There, costs are very high in the lawsuits taken out by laboratories making an innovative medicine, claiming the similarity of an analogous drug.
What kinds of medicament could the country make with a budget like this?
-- Those that don't show any complex chemistry and that are not complicated to synthesize.
If getting the molecule is complex, the price will be high.
It's common for Brazilian researchers to identify molecules, but not to arrive at the medicament for the lack of someone to finance it.
Why does this happen?
-- Lack of interest.
I'm a pharmacologist.
I was brought up in the pharmaceutical industry and I want to make medicine, which is the way I have for controlling a biological phenomenon.
But the viability of doing this needs to be seen.
Here, there is no chemistry for medicaments, medicines are not synthesized.
Why doesn't this exist?
-- We missed the bus.
We never had personnel prepared.
And for copying, you can't compete in price with countries like India and China.
The cost of labor in these countries is very low, and there is the so-called ecological subsidy.
Ecological subsidy?
Why is the river like it is, polluted?
Because there is a certain level of loss that is accepted.
For the Tietê to get like the Thames, in London, the industries will have to leave here, and the sewage will have to be treated.
There's a cost.
Synthesizing medicines for Europe and the United States is done in India and in China.
Cubatão ( maybe the most polluted city in Brazil), for example, is the way it is because there is a subsidy: "You can produce in this place, do whatever comes into your head, and we don't care."
It's an option of society.
Wouldn't it then be the case for Brazil to use China and India as well for synthesizing medicines?
-- Synthesizing medicines has no value.
The problem is not synthesizing, but the intellectual property that is generated.
It's knowledge that has value.
But I think it's too complicated for us to catch this bus again.
In Canada, 80% of the people between 18 and 25 are at university.
In Brazil, this figure reaches 8%.
The bus is going to pass even further away.
We are much more underdeveloped today than 20 years ago.
Couldn't Brazilian biodiversity be a source of molecules and extracts that would be the basis for new remedies?
-- That's a romantic vision.
Aren't you underestimating the country's role and its weight?
Except for that, I don't see anything exceptional here.
Commodities?
Perhaps Brazil has the largest herd of cattle, perhaps it's one of the biggest producers of chicken in the world.
Would it be interesting to produce an entirely national medicament, from the discovery of the molecule to the pill?
-- No.
The fundamental thing is the added value, the concept, the idea of the molecule.
The second most important thing in life, after your existence, what is it?
Time.
Who does this well?
France, Italy, Hong Kong?
So I'm going to produce where they do it good and fast.
But, in this aspect, the idea of the new molecules, isn't Brazil doing well?
After all, Brazilian researchers have already published several works about molecules that are effective against some diseases.
That is to say, hasn't the most difficult step, the fundamental one, already been taken?
-- I believe not.
I'll probably not get a job any more after this answer.
There's a certain jingoism in saying that Brazilian scientific production is 1% of the works published.
But that is the figure from the ISI (Institute of Scientific Information), which, inactual fact, estimates that 1.5% of the articles published in international periodicals are by Brazilians.
You are one of the most cited Brazilian researchers, according to the ISI.
-- There's a list of most cited scientists.
There are three Brazilians on it: Boris Vargafgit, who has lived the whole of his life in France.
The other is a colleague from Unicamp, Jorge Stolfi.
-- Yes, but they are foreigners generating knowledge there.
It's a difficult issue.
The leap forward that the Third World has to make is a very big one.
In Brazil, the view still persists that everything has to be done here.
It doesn't work.
That's not how a medicine is made.
The second is to make ideas viable for reaching the market and knowing how to be able to achieve this.
When one manages to invest and to create a new fact, there will certainly be capital, whether from the country or from outside.
For the product to reach the market...
-- Ideas that are good and viable are few.
Is there a lack of entrepreneurism in the universities?
These offices today stimulate the drafting of patents.
As less than 0.01% of patents are commercially viable, this must generate a great expense without the necessaryquid pro quo .
In this kind of office, who is going to negotiate with the laboratory is an economist, who has no idea of what the purpose of what was created is.
It's the scientist who wants his discovery to reach the market that has to know who to look for.
To negotiate with a large company, you have to have notions of market and marketing.
Couldn't the patent office have a role in all this?
They think that industry is going to steal.
In an interview about the Brazilian Viagra, they asked me: "Did the university keep part of the royalties?"
It was the laboratory Cristália that did the synthesizing of the drug.
They are negotiating its development.
I earned as a professional for developing the product.
Didn't the university earn anything?
It did: it had no onus and made it possible for a medicine to be created.
But didn't you use anything of the university?
-- I used my time, I'm also paid by the university.
Nothing else?
I did a few experiments at the university.
The new Law on Innovation provides for professors at public universities also being able to have a relationship with private companies.
-- That means creating a law to remove the trammels from other laws.
It's a view of those who think that the universities are being jeopardized.
We do not generate anything, that's the big truth.
Instead of creating laws all the time, people should let things flow.
If the universities don't have a legal mechanism for charging royalties, it doesn't matter, because the sale of the new medicine moves the country's economy.
Something goes to the State in the form of taxes.
After there are results, you learn to deal with this question.
So wouldn't there have to be some rule at a second moment?
Once I made FAPESP a proposal.
Why can't we sell to private industry expensive equipment that is becoming outdated for doing research?
The university's laboratory would keep 50% of the sale and FAPESP the other 50%.
But this can't be done, because we are dealing with public assets.
Are you in favor of the existence of public laboratories for producing medicines, like Far-Manguinhos?
-- Far-Manguinhos [Fiocruz's Drug Technology Institute, in Rio de Janeiro], Furp [Popular Medicine Foundation, in the state of São Paulo], all this should be closed down as quickly as possible.
The Bristol-Myers Squibb laboratory produces captopril in one or two places in the world.
In Brazil, there are some 20 official laboratories making this medicine.
But there won't be medicine for free.
There is a strategic error of the government: it's not a function of government to make medicine.
Is it a problem of management?
The government's function is to ensure the population access to medicines?
How could this happen?
-- There may be health policies in relation to the pharmaceutical industry.
In France, the government says: "I'm going to pay so much for this medicine.
If you sell at this price, I'll buy it and offer it to the population".
-- In Europe, the health insurance companies pay for generic medicines for their customers.
If you don't like the generic and want the one with a brand, you pay the difference.
The government is able to organize the market and to stop supplying medicines that should have already been prohibited because they cause harm to the patient.
I usually say: "The doctor's function is to do a diagnosis and to prescribe a remedy.
To indicate the right treatment".
Whether the patient can buy the medicine or not has never been a medical problem.
That is up to another professional.
-- To the politicians, to those who are going to manage health systems, to the hospital administrators.
And if the patient says: "It costs R$ 100 and I haven't got any money"?
-- The medical function is diagnosis and treatment.
It stops there.
It's a problem of distribution of earnings and of having a system that protects the poorer people.
-- Yes, but it's not the doctor's function to protect the patients.
Do you believe in homeopathy?
-- I have no scientific evidence that it works.
But I don't work with homeopathy.
When the French biochemist Jacques Benveniste published that work in Nature [in 1988, showing that the water molecule could be capable of storing information about compounds diluted in it], I was in England.
I asked James Black, the Nobel prizewinner in Medicine in 1988, what he thought of the study.
Black commented that other works were showing evidence about this issue of alterations in the water molecule.
He's a Nobel laureate and he didn't say that it was impossible.
know Jacques well.
He's an excellent scientist, the discoverer, before this story of homeopathy, of an important compound: PAF-acether, a platelet-activating factor.
But Jacques is a guy from the left, a communist, with political ideas contrary to the establishment.
That is, his profile displeased many.
-- In this respect, there's a funny story.
In Britain, Sir Cyril Burt [a psychologist who died in 1971] exerted a great influence for altering the country's educational system.
On the basis of studies with identical twins, he said that intelligence was determined by genetics.
Burt won prizes and died in glory, with collaborators abroad.
An American statistician saw that it was impossible to arrive at that data.
He published an article and was sent packing.
What he was sayingwas regarded as a crime, like defaming Jesus Christ.
They went to listen to Burt's collaborators.
But they didn't exist.
People believe in personalities and not in science?
-- They believe in what they want to believe in.
After discovering that a concept doesn't hold water, everybody demonstrates the same thing.
Even if before they had proved the opposite.
Optimist and raving, but not too much
In a 15-minute documentary made by Walter Lima Júnior in 2004, at one point Thomaz Farkas, 82 years old, tells that he ought to have been born in Brazil, because in 1924 his parents were already living over here.
Without many resources, when the moment of the birth drew close, they asked Farkas's maternal grandmother for financial assistance; she was ``a bit of a skinflint'' and on top of that didn't like her son-in-law very much.
It was only when he was 5 years old that he was to arrive in São Paulo -- to remain in this city for all of his life.
Years later, Farkas was to become a fundamental figure in the history of the Brazilian cinema, with his zeal for producing or co-producing, with his own resources, almost two score documentaries of different lengths, which had the intention of showing the Brazilians the various and truest faces of Brazil.
What was that?
From São Paulo, small teams led by different filmmakers would set out, eager to explore the country.
They would set off bound for the North, the Northeast, the South and the Center-West, they would burrow into the Southeast, São Paulo itself, in an impressive desire to reveal where we are from, after all.
But Thomaz Farkas was not only the producer of so many films.
A photographer of fine images, concerned with the supposedly classical sameness of the framing that used to dominate Brazilian photography in the 1940s, for this reason a renovator of language, he went to teach photojournalism for a few decades at the Communication School of the University of São Paulo (USP).
And now that he was at USP, he saw himself obliged to do a doctorate.
In his thesis, which will be transformed into a book by Cosac Naify, he dealt with the production of documentaries in Brazil.
Graduated in engineering from USP's Polytechnic, he did very little with this degree, because after all he had to handle his work as a businessman: Farkas was the owner of Fotoptica, a chain of photography shops.
In the following interview, he talks a bit and with much humor, almost always, about these various facets.
And he offers as a present to the readers of Pesquisa FAPESP the marvelous photos of his authorship that are in the four central pages of the space dedicated to the interview.
Oh, incidentally: in the film by Walter Lima Júnior, the title of which is Thomaz Farkas, Brazilian, he confesses that he ``would have chosen Bahia'' had he been given the right to choose a place to be born.
Did you read the interview with Fernando Birri [in Pesquisa FAPESP issue 127]?
-- It's because we are very good friends, and since he came to Brazil for the first time, it was to help us.
Some Argentineans came here having been put to flight.
Maurício Berú, who was also a filmmaker, arrive and phoned me from the airport, ``Look, we are here, me, my wife and two children''.
It was you who went to fetch them.
-- Yes, because you know how it is, the guy who escapes for political reasons comes in the clothes he is wearing.
I know about this, this refugee business...
My family is Jewish, I left Hungary in 1930.
But did your father came as an exile as well?
-- No, daddy came out of work.
He was a draftsman at an arms factory in Hungary.
Hungary lost the war, the factory closed, and he left Hungary.
He went to several places.
My uncle, his brother, already know Brazil.
He went to fetch daddy and sent him over here, to found Fotoptica, in 1920.
I think that in those days, in the sector, there was only Lutz Ferrando, if I am not mistaken.
Conrado Wessel did not exist yet?
-- The factory?
Yes, it did.
I have an excellent letter from Conrado.
He was a marvelous person.
Well, daddy came, founded Fotoptica, then went back to Hungary, married my mother and I was born in 1924.
Ah, I want to tell you about my first filming.
I read in the newspaper that Pixinguinha was going to play with his band, and in those days there was little Brazilian regional music, there was a lot of American and European music...
I saw that, picked up my 16 millimeter, silent camera and a tripod.
It was a camera imported from the United States.
-- A Kodak.
A very good camera.
I have it to this date, kept safe.
They played and danced at the same time, all of them, and it was a marvelous spectacle.
I filmed I think eight minutes, there were two 100-foot rolls, four minutes each, and what was left of film I filmed at home, my children in the bath, family stuff.
That was 52 years ago.
The film got lost there in my office.
And one day, four or five years ago, I began to tidy things up a bit and, suddenly, I found a small film.
The film was silent.
I revealed it and thought it was a marvel.
It was seven, eight minutes long.
Then I amplified it to 35 millimeters and went to the Moreira Salles Institute to see whether they could discover the music they were playing.
They did discover it, OK.
It's a marvel, with them playing and dancing.
You see the knife on the plate, you see the pandeiro ( a kind of tambourine) ...
Before we talk about photography, let's talk about your experience with documentaries.
-- We did an exploratory trip through the country, Geraldo [Sarno], Paulo Rufino and I, in 1967 and 1968.
I had some ideas, they did as well, and the first one was to film the revolution of Julião in Pernambuco.
The Peasant Leagues of Francisco Julião.
We decided not to go, and as I had a piece of equipment that had just arrived, we began to think about what we were going to do.
And Sérgio Muniz, later on, also went to look.
I mean, there were people traveling over various regions with the idea of showing Brazil to the Brazilians.
Then I thought that showing the people of Rio Grande do Sul to the people of São Paulo, to the people from the Northeast, and vice-versa, was a novelty that could possibly set off a revolution, at least in the mind.
And then I explained, ``That's not misery, that is how people live''.
And he said, ``Yes, but in these days of dictatorship, they are going to think that I am wanting to show something ugly...'' So nothing was shown on the television in those days.
How were these journeys done, inside the Northeast, afterwards, a bit over the South etc.?
Before that, I had a jeep, and all the filming was done using these cars.
Sérgio Muniz went to the South.
The exploratory journeys happens and afterwards you would go back and make the documentaries?
-- Some films had already been made before, starting in 1964.
We made this exploratory trip and afterwards we met, with the question: ``What are we going to do?''
At that moment, Glauber [Rocha] asked for Geraldo Sarno to come here, because he was getting in the way up there.
Geraldo is a Bahian from Poções, everything was from Bahia...
Geraldo came to join the group.
They had come from the Santa Fé Cinema School.
They had been through there before 1963, with Fernando Birri.
-- Precisely.
So they brought one experience, Geraldo brought another experience, and he suggested Paulo Gil [Soares], who was a marvelous person, and the plan was born: get the C-14, the equipment I had, and get on board.
One cinematographer, one director, and me driving the car.
And your role was that of a sort of coordinator, a general producer of this project?
-- I was a producer.
I had to arrange for the money, I had to pay them, I had to buy material, have them developed.
And how were the funds raised at that moment?
-- They weren't raised, it was me paying it in directly.
So you were the great financier of the Brazilian documentary.
I had some money that I earned, a monthly allowance, in short, and I had saved.
Also, they weren't today's salaries, they were normal salaries.
Today, the prices are sky high.
What there was in the region, we filmed.
-- How they lived.
So we make, instead of 10, 20 films, 30 films.
In all, counting those that were made before and after these journeys, there are 39 films, between 1964 and 1980.
There is also a full length film, there are films produced in São Paulo.
Viramundo [Wounds in Brazilian Society], for example, was made here, in 1965.
We made films in the South, like Andiamo In'mérica [Let's Go to America] [1977-78], which is about Italian immigrants.
In short, we did heaps of things.
The majority of the films were of 10 to 15 minutes?
-- Let's say from 10 to 40 minutes.
Some would be full length.
Sérgio Muniz filmed Andiamo In'mérica as a program that Embrafilme wanted to finance to show on the TV.
But he saw that he had material for two 40-minute films.
He also made Rastejador, s.m.
[Tracker, masculine noun][1970], which is about a guy who used to help to find tracks of bandits in the Caatinga.
At the same time, he did Beste [Crossbow] [1970], about this same tracker making a crossbow to kill little animals.
A crossbow is a small bow and arrow.
The editing was at my house, in Pacaembu.
And all the documentaries were filmed in 16 millimeters, or already in 35?
-- The majority was is 16 millimeters.
But there was also some in 35 millimeter, like Memória do cangaço [Memories of the Cangaço][1965], by Paulo Gil.
We used to show them in the university circuit, the parallel circuit.
I remember when Joris Ivens came here; he was a Dutch documentarian, marvelous, he brought Heaven and Earth, a film that he had made in Vietnam.
I projected this film at home, someone got up and said, ``This is communist stuff'', and left.
It was back on the 1970s that he made an agreement with the French filmmaker Pierre Kast, wasn't it?
Pierre came because I had a friend who was a friend of Glauber, Claude Antoine.
Well, when Pierre Kast wanted to do a series here for French television, Claude Antoine brought the French producer, I joined him, a each of us went in with some money to finance this Carnets brésiliens, which is a marvel, narrated in French, show on French television.
-- It's a film about the general culture of Brazil, something more urban.
In fact, Pierre worked hard, he did everything on his own.
For example: the film about Vinicius de Morais, which has now come out in DVD, has two passages that are in Carnets: the little group from the shantytown dancing, and the colored footage from Vinicius's house.
What was your connection like with the Brazilian Association of Documentarians, created in 1975, if I'm not mistaken?
-- The Brazilian documentarians were us.
I mean, before us there was León Hirszman, who made a film about Brasília.
-- Look, we were a group.
I wasn't going to found anything, nor was I going to make a group, but there was the gang that was working with me in those days.
What was it like for you to reconcile the production of a documentary and also to take care of Fotoptica?
-- In Fotoptica, I had partners, and they would run the company.
I would pass by there, go back home to take care of something, to take care of the development.
Once in a while, I would go and have a look at how the folks were filming.
Photography, in those days, was a bit abandoned.
Photos of scenes?
-- Photos of scenes and settings.
I mean, they would take a photograph of what they wanted to do, set it up, and work with photography before filming, because it was expensive to film and to photograph was cheaper.
Then the group I talked about was formed and I helped to finance the documentaries at that moment, because I was able to.
Incidentally, in 2005, they, along with three other students from the institution in those days, in a fine homage by the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
Well, the fact is that the group went to see you, and you simply gave them all the negatives to make the filming viable.
-- I didn't even remember that.
-- No, I was a sympathizer.
I used to contribute to those things that I understood to be important, but I wasn't linked to the party.
To belong to the party, you had to have discipline, study Marx, Engels.
So it was a question of contributing to productions that seemed to you to carry the idea of transformation?
I gave for a film about Lula the images that I had of his first political rallies.
To film today on film is very expensive, but in a way everything has changed, because it's done digitally.
So that is a very interesting revolution.
We used to film 3 meters to use 1.
Today, you film and afterwards see what has turned out, which is very different.
It may be excellent and it may be nonsense.
Modern photography is the same thing in digital.
In the old days, you would use almost everything, because it was expensive to develop and to make copies.
That was a very serious problem for the first decades of Brazilian cinema, wasn't it?
-- Buying films, developing them, afterwards there was the crew, which was already expensive, the camera was rented.
This here was the most important thing...
Ah, the mask.
that I had because, as a photographer, and as a person, I always see things like this [Farkas looks through the cardboard frame, literally framing what he is looking at].
Then the notion of framing that you developed comes into the scene...
-- People see what they frame, you understand?
What interests me is what I see, I don't not see everything.
Although my vision goes from one side to the other, I am always concentrating.
And even with the photograph after enlargement, I cut a bit off, I decide: I'm not going to enlarge everything.
So, for me, photography is vision.
Reality is not in photography.
But this comprehension of yours about framing in photography, which comes from the 1940s, had a strong influence, decades later, on the teaching of photography schools.
-- I think it did.
But each one, each filmmaker, has his way of seeing.
What was the problem with photography done prior to the 1940s?
-- It was a copy out of its time of old, classical things.
I fled from that.
What cameras do you keep on using?
-- I had a Nikon, but it got heavy and my doctor said, ``If you carry on working with that camera, you'll become a hunchback''.
I bought a Leica, which is nice and light, but I still have the Rolleiflex.
I have so much material accumulated to be organized that there's no time.
-- When I saw that the ECA was going to be formed, I thought, ``That interests me, because I do cinema, and they may want a teacher of cinema''.
But that department already had a photography professor, and Rudá proposed that I should teach photojournalism.
So for many years I taught the folks from the journalism school to take some photographs, because the reporter often goes into the field alone, without any photographer with him, and in this way he could take the photo himself.
I had very good pupils, some of them marvelous.
What was the problem with the professors?
-- A lot of envy, a lot of disputes, and I always wanted to stay clear of that.
-- I had to do it to stay in the school.
The theme was films.
And things ended up being very interesting, because the first bench proposed was not accepted by the director of the school.
What was the argument used against the bench?
-- They invented that Paulo Emílio and Maria Isaura were fresh doctors.
My supervisor, Flávio Motta, who was a genius, did a marvelous reply to the director, the rector, tearing the allegations into shreds.
But I was only able to defend my thesis a long time after.
Now the Cosac Naify publishing house wants to publish the book, because it is the first thesis about documentaries made in Brazil.
I hope the book comes out while I am alive.
We have here in the photo appendix to the thesis Paulo Gil with the crew at Taperoá, and photographer Afonso Beato, today with many awards...
-- He worked with us.
He is a marvelous photographer.
And here are Lauro Escorel, Geraldo Sarno, Edgardo Pallero, who came from Santa Fé and stayed here in Brazil.
Fernando Birri, for example, used to schedule a meeting with filmmakers at 10 o'clock, in some place in Rio.
He would go, the filmmakers wouldn't turn up.
He would get mad.
Pallero would say 10 o'clock, the filmmakers weren't there, he would go to the beach and find everyone there.
That was the big difference between the two.
Pallero, who is now dead, was a great teacher.
You said that you never worked with photojournalism and were going to say something about your work as a photographer.
-- The thing is that I am a borderline photographer -- I am not an amateur, but nor am I a professional, I don't make my living from this.
I'd like to, but I don't.
Have you never earned money with your photographic work?
-- No, nor with cinema.
Rather, a little bit of money is now coming in with cinema.
They all receive a part corresponding to the minutage.
I don't owe anything to anyone.
How was the proposal that César Lattes made you to photograph experiments that he was carrying out with cosmic rays?
I said, ``How am I going to do that?''
Then I invented a system of putting the camera in a fixed place and opening the shutter until this ray passed through.
That was very advanced for me.
The things he talked about were very complicated.
-- Yes, when they passed through some place they would become visible.
And that is precisely when I had to photograph them.
Where did you do these experiments?
-- At the Poly, if I'm not mistaken.
I left the Poly in 1946, 1947, as an engineer graduated in mechanics and electricity.
And I practically never practiced engineering.
It was a very interesting laboratory, with ten enlargers, for ten people to photograph and to develop their photographs, a very fine affair.
What led you to engineering?
-- I was born in 1924.
We gathered the family together for a discussion ``What do you want to study?
Do you want to be a lawyer?''
I didn't even know what that was, it didn't even occur to me.
``Do you want to do engineering?''
I decided, ``OK, I'm going to do engineering''.
-- Yes, it was the most palpable thing.
You went in by an entrance exam.
-- I am an only child.
My mother worked as a cashier, daddy in the shop, with the employees.
And I used to help serve at the counter.
I always worked in Fotoptica for as long as I could.
How did Fotoptica's expansion occur?
-- After my graduation, people came from other places, a guy came from Mesbla, we opened the store in Conselheiro Crispiniano street and we went on opening other branches.
The last stage was when we took money lent from a bank to refurbish everything, to put in a laboratory and modern optical equipment, to transform everything into a marvel.
There were already 20 or so stores.
It so happened that the bank's interest, suddenly, became impossible to pay.
When?
-- Seven or eight years ago.
We divided the money between my four children, my ex-wife and me.
There was a bit left for everyone.
-- I never saw myself as a Maecenas.
It was a political ambition to make those films.
And obviously it was the time to do so.
My life is image.
Almost all my children work with image.
Now, I have a grand-daughter, Pedro's daughter, who is a cinema assistant.
My grandfather had a photography shop in Hungary.
So it was my grandfather, my father, me, Pedro, and now Maria.
That's five generations.
I have another grand-daughter who is studying at Faap [Armando Álvares Penteado Foundation] and is now making films as well.
Talking about political ambition, were you imprisoned in the 1970s?
-- I no longer remember exactly which year it was.
I know that it was after a denouncement.
Somebody said that I had sold military binoculars to the guerrillas.
Military binoculars are made especially for the Army, they aren't sold to the public.
I was arrested, they interrogated me...
Did they go to your house to arrest you?
-- They went to Fotoptica.
I sat between two guys, I didn't know what was up, and they asked me a load of questions.
I said, ``Look, it's nothing like that''.
And I remained there in Tutóia street [São Paulo HQ of the 2nd Army] one week.
And folks began to stir.
I wasn't maltreated, but I saw people leaving from maltreatment.
My son Pedro was a minor and remained imprisoned for some months.
-- Because he was holding meetings in the house in Guarujá.
It was the youngsters who were taking part in that, who were making plans.
I knew nothing.
I wasn't aware of everything.
They had independence.
Do you think that the way that culture and politics were treated in the years of the dictatorship still projects reflections today?
-- I think that a natural process of Brazilian development was interrupted.
And for you to redo the cut of the tree I don't know to this date what the effect of this is, I don't, but it had an effect.
It changed people's minds, everything changed.
Was there a certain notion of how a kind of development of a country was being created from this cultural activity?
-- It was a thing of suggesting ideas.
And there was an interruption, which lasts almost to this day.
Were the possibilities of a cultural connection that we had with Latin America were aborted at that moment?
-- No, you can forget the idea of a connection between Brazil and the rest of Latin America.
There was perhaps with Argentina, a bit with Uruguay.
Chile was very far away and we didn't even have a plane to the rest of America.
Today you have a connection with everything.
In the old days, we had a connection with Europe and United States.
Only.
Wasn't there a Latin American movement?
We went to a meeting in Viña del Mar, but that was afterwards.
The Latin American convergence was later.
Guido [Araújo] tried to do the Brazilian one first, the Latin American one afterwards, and now it's an international journey.
How do you see the lines of development of the Brazilian cinema today?
-- I think that there is very great progress.
Both in ideas and in achievement.
There are some very good things.
But I think that it's doing well.
That makes possible a new reflection about ourselves, which country we have built?
They are different from the films made here in São Paulo.
Folks are also going to the North and Northeast to film some extremely interesting things.
Have you always filmed the themes you have wanted to?
-- What has always interested me is people, practices, customs, what Brazil is.
I used to like this very much, I still do, and I do what I can.
When I travel, I always take the camera and see what there is.
Do you stay more here or in Paraty?
-- Here.
Because my social and cultural life is here.
Paraty is a paradise.
Fabrício Marques and Ricardo Zorzetto
A professor at the Scientific and Technological Policy Department at the Unicamp Geosciences Institute, she evaluates, strictly and with balance, themes such as international cooperation in science and technology and the assessment of public policies for science and technology.
She is critical, for instance, of Brazilians holding only lowly positions within major research networks and feels that it would be appropriate to resume the policy of sending Brazilians abroad to complete their doctorates, in order to create leadership on a par with foreigners.
She also criticizes the indiscriminate use of conventional indices for evaluating scientific and academic production, which may generate confusion, often leading to injustice.
An agricultural engineering graduate, Léa Velho began her career as a university professor at Unesp, in the town of Jaboticabal, in the seventies.
Her interest in scientific and technological policy dates back to 1978, when she moved to Brasilia, for family reasons, and was invited to work as a technician in the evaluation of projects in her field for the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).
In 1985, she completed her doctorate in Technological and Scientific Policy at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex in the UK.
She left CNPq in 1991 to teach at Unicamp.
From 2001 to 2005, she was a senior researcher and director of post-graduate studies at the Institute for New Technologies at the United Nations University in Maastricht, in Holland.
Below, some segments of her interview:
How important is this involvement?
``In the recent knowledge production movement, there is a major trend toward collaborative research.
This is growing far more than isolated research; it is also mentioned more often and therefore has a greater impact.
When one looks at European scientific production, however, one sees that international cooperation has been rising exponentially.
Yet Brazil has had a modest level of cooperation.
Although cooperation has grown, it has maintained the same level of about 30% of articles written jointly with other countries since the late eighties.''
Thirty per cent of all articles?
``Thirty per cent of Brazilian articles published in the Science Citation Index involved international co-authoring.
What does this mean?
It can mean many things, even that we are not very involved with this movement, less than we could be.
I think Brazil participates little.
My experience taking part in EU projects shows that partnering occurs much more when they are obliged, over there, to include a few Latin American countries according to the call notice.
They know that you exist and they say: don't you want to take part?
And we end up involved rather marginally.
You rarely get the local support you need, for instance, to travel and to take part in discussions held over there.
Consider the case of the bioprospection networks that I have written articles about.
The initiative is taken by a northern country and the funds come from there.
What do researchers actually gain by belonging to a network?
``They acquire skills such as negotiating the objective of the research, the methodology or the use of equipment.
At most, I tell my students to do certain things and they do them.
But negotiating with your peers, who have their own ideas about things, is an advantage.''
Aren't there any national groups that are sufficiently mature to deal with foreigners as equals?
``There are several mature groups in Brazil that probably take part on a more egalitarian footing, which has to do with their negotiation capabilities.
Those who know what they want and have the resources to meet their requirements join the project out of real interest.
The researcher joins because he/she has something to contribute.
That is not the case of bioprospection networks.''
Is this what happened in relation to the drug and Aids vaccine research networks?
``In the paper I wrote about this I was trying to see how Brazil took part in the clinical tests for the vaccine's development.
Unfortunately, this is an area in which Brazilian competence is inadequate.
From the standpoint of policy design, the Aids program has been very successful in Brazil.
We do basic research well.
There are very good doctors, but we still need to develop this in-between level, the capability of conducting clinical tests with laboratories that are suitable for doing all the analyses and capable of developing reliable protocols.
We must start doing clinical tests for drugs that we ourselves develop; otherwise, we will continue being providers of services for multinationals.''
There are virtually no drugs developed in Brazil
To conclude this network issue, we have to solve certain things.
Do we want to join these international networks?
The path taken so far was the right one; I'm not questioning that, but the country can't close itself off and say that now we have such strong post-graduate programs that we don't need to train anyone overseas!
Few people go abroad for a full doctorate.
And many go abroad because Capes (the Coordinating Office for the Training of Personnel with Higher Education) decides to provide 500 grants and chooses those who stand out in each field of knowledge.
This doesn't work, because the few resources earmarked for foreign training are diluted and the country doesn't take any quantum jump in any field.
So we should specify the areas, make a list and send these people to be trained over there.
I am referring to the policy of enhancing training in certain fields and of penetrating certain specific networks, since we can't join all of them.''
The complaint about doctorates abroad is that the most talented Brazilians receive good job offers and don't come back.
``Data from the US center that monitors foreign students indicate that most Brazilians do want to come back.
If they don't it's because they don't have the opportunity to take a qualifying exam.
The truth is that only a few are going abroad.''
``I don't see much benefit in this program and it is certainly no replacement for the relationships established during a full doctorate abroad.
Generally, the post-graduate students spend six months to a year abroad and frequently they don't write a single paper in a foreign language.
Social sciences researchers who do their doctorates in Brazil rarely manage to publish a paper in English.
So I go over there and within six months I learn the technique.
When they completed the required credits, they were called back.
They were not required to produce a thesis.
They just went abroad to acquire certain types of knowledge, take some subjects and take part in the discussion of projects.
The degree didn't matter.
The issue was training human resources to acquire knowledge.
Having knowledge of knowledge is one of the very important competences that PhDs acquire.
It's knowing who does what and where.
When you're doing a doctorate abroad, you see researchers from a range of universities; you start figuring out who's who; and you discover where these people publish.
The other side of this is that many of those who complete their doctorates don't have a job.
``In the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, which produce half of the world's wealth, most PhDs work in industry.
There are exceptions, like Mexico, but this trend among the Asian Tigers, such as Korea and Taiwan, is even stronger than in some European countries.
All studies about the role of qualified human resources for innovation very clearly see that companies achieve major gains when there are people with master's degrees or PhDs working in their R&D units.
A company with no qualified personnel has difficulty with this interface.
In Brazil, almost as a rule, for a company to remain in the market, it is more advantageous to buy equipment or license technology from abroad.
Because there is an excess of PhDs, doesn`t mean that companies will hire them.
One has to think about what to do to encourage domestic companies or the subsidiaries of foreign companies in Brazil to create an environment in which it becomes advantageous to innovate using domestic resources and knowledge.''
Many companies have started to wake up to the importance of innovation, because they need to export and be competitive abroad
It is a new fact, this awareness among firms that they have to innovate in order to remain in the market, to export quality products, or else nobody will buy from them.''
But aren't they changing their behavior?
``It's hard to tell.
This line of discourse is recent and only recently have studies of this nature begun.
What one does know is that nowadays they have the discourse.
We train people to be civil servants.
Capes released a ranking that puts Brazil among the 25 countries with the greatest scientific productivity.
What does this represent?
``Everybody that works seriously with scientific production knows that it is difficult to compare countries' performances, because they are not equivalent.
One country may focus on medical research, another on agricultural research, a third one on engineering, while in another one the social sciences are important.
That is valid.
But I don't think it's as valid to conclude that Brazil's production grows faster than India's.
What does this say in terms of developing local policy?
Almost nothing.''
Brazil's position in terms of number of articles published is good, but when one assesses the impact of these articles, then the country's position in the ranking is weaker.
What does this mean?
``Impact is measured by the number of citations.
Here we start getting bogged down, because the motivations for mentioning a paper vary greatly from area to area.
Physics, for instance, is very dynamic and international.
There is a community that is always working at the forefront of knowledge and that has very few journals regarded as important.
So it is valid to compare whether Brazilian physics has a large or a small impact versus US physics.
However, regarding the issue of the impact of Brazilian scientific production as a whole, one really can't compare things.
There is a principle that all serious measurers of science repeat: `One can only compare similar things.'
We aren't like the others.''
The most recent data show that we have almost 2% of global production, according to the Science Citation Index, making Brazil the 15th producer of science in the world.
Can't one draw anything from these statistics?
We're growing faster than the others.
So what?
Doesn't that mean that our science is more mature?
It means that we're publishing more in the journals listed in the Science Citation Index, which are considered the best publications.
We publish a lot, but the impact of our publications doesn't improve much.
Impact is a measure that gets in the way of making comparisons between areas.
One can never say that the impact of a biotechnology paper is greater than that of a physics paper.
It would be conceptually wrong; nevertheless, people make these comparisons every day.''
And this is even happening in order to evaluate researchers individually.
``This is the other principle: `One doesn't use these data to evaluate researchers individually.'
Never.
For collaboration?
``Yes, it was created with the following spirit in mind: the world of science is getting very large; I work on a given line of research and can't cope with looking at all the literature.
How can I figure out what matters?
Based on citations, the researcher can design his networks.
But soon people realized that this could be used for evaluation.
Then they started to play around with certain concepts and to find that those who were quoted more often were better quality.
The reasons why a person quotes a given article, or not, are totally unknown.
There is no theory of citations.
People still don't know very well what leads a researcher to quote or not quote a given article.
From my experience, I know that second-hand citations are proliferating.
I mentioned physics as a field in which one can say that international citations reflect impact.
But take another area, the social sciences, for instance, in which the researcher doesn't publish abroad.
And that is not a Brazilian phenomenon.
Take a country such as Brazil, in which a significant share of the scientific production, community and resources are allocated to the social sciences: the Science Citation Index doesn't take these data into account.
I'd say that eighty percent of the social sciences production is not covered by this figure that Capes is forever divulging, that is the growth of Brazilian scientific production.
Of course that's not how things work.
Interpreting the data calls for a deep understanding of the database's design, of its conceptual basis and of its methodological limitations.''
``Take an institute like ours, Geosciences, which consists of five departments.
It's the most varied thing in the world.
One is Geosciences another, Geography, which can be Human Geography or Physical Geography; there are people in Scientific and Technological Policy, in Teaching and History of Geosciences and in Petroleum Engineering.
For all intents, because we are lumped under Geosciences at Unicamp, we are supposed to be exact sciences.
When they do an institutional evaluation, they put us together with the exact sciences.
Then we do poorly, because we have fewer publications and citations than Physics, Chemistry or Mathematics.
And as a result of that, we lose out in the allocation of internal resources.
But can you compare the Geosciences Institute with Physics?
It's like wiping the slate clean and saying: they have to behave like the others in the exact sciences.
But we don't have to behave that way.
We are not in Physics.
Scientific and Technological Policy is part of Social Sciences.
Are there other, more effective means of evaluation?
``Bibliometry is an important tool for evaluation.
But it must always be used in conjunction with other means of evaluation, based on a prior awareness of the dynamics of knowledge production in certain areas.''
``It's complicated.
How many countries have a post-graduate system like ours?
None.
Mexico produces the largest number of PhDs in its postgraduate programs, but even so, the evaluation of all these programs is only beginning now, as in Brazil.
Evidently, a fair proportion of what we publish comes out of the postgraduate programs.''
``Argentina is far more complicated, because it has very few formal doctoral programs.''
Do they have a scientific tradition?
But the structure of scientific research over there is quite different.
Argentina lacks this formal postgraduate system for training researchers.
Another difference is that we have a postgraduate system based on professors who work full time.
Here one earns a decent living as a professor, providing guidance and doing research at government universities, in both the state and in the federal universities.
If one gets a grant, it's a plus.
If you take on a project, it's a plus.
But we don't need this to live decently.
In no other Latin American country is this the case.
In Argentina, for a researcher to make a living, he must be a part-time professor at one place, a part-time researcher elsewhere ''
Is free tuition common in other countries?
``That's another fundamental difference.
Our best post-graduate programs are free.
This doesn't exist anywhere else.
Postgraduate studies in Argentina have to be paid for.
In Mexico, most of it is paid.
The good schools training PhDs in Chile, for instance, which are mainly in basic fields, are all paid.
I feel proud when I tell people that we do it free of charge.
Is this a problem?
``The only way to get a Nobel Prize, if this is an objective, is really to try to examine some of the issues that are very particular to us and from a point of view that is also very particular to us.
Renato Dagnino, my colleague here at Unicamp, usually says that Latin America's only major contribution to scientific knowledge was the Cepal School.
The theory of structuralism, of dependence, is a major Brazilian contribution to knowledge.
And we got to it by looking at our own reality from our own standpoint.
We lose out when we look at reality through the eyes of the North, because they have more appropriate tools than ours for working from that point of view.
Perhaps if we could find out what is relevant within our physical, natural and social reality and describe this from our very own point of view we might produce a major contribution to science.
In some areas, we need to use our creativity and exercise a different thought process.
However, in answer to your question, I'm not very worried about a Nobel Prize.''
``Though I think international recognition's important, I'd like the production of Brazilian knowledge to be really useful in solving our problems, rather than being a mere reproduction.''
Any specific area?
And it's not just a corporate problem.
What about the small farmer, who is unable to pay?
Suddenly, the solution for this country began to be channeled exclusively through the private sector.
At the Ministry of Science and Technology, the key word at present is `company'.
As I worked for CNPq in the seventies and eighties, I can see how the discourse has changed.''
What was it like, back then?
``In my time, it was about strengthening the public sector.
The term was ``technical change'', a far more linear process, in which one invested in basic research, followed by applied research, then development; and all this would lead to innovation.
As if the issue was lack of communication.''
And wasn't it?
When they are together, they negotiate their requirements and their problem-solving possibilities.''
There is another issue that you study, that of Big Science in Brazil.
Are these major projects interesting for national science?
``Brazil has chosen to move in the same direction as international science.
What does joining Big Science mean?
First, we must define what Big Science is.
There are people who think that Big Science is merely science that spends a lot.
Actually, it's not.
It involves the collective work of several fields of knowledge.
Take the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory.
There are several teams working together, from several areas of specialization.
Big Science means working with very large, multidisciplinary teams, with several types of training.
They have to negotiate the meaning of what they have done and the papers have as much as ten, fifteen or twenty authors.
Maintaining all this costs money.
We imagined that the said laboratory would generate revenue, that industry would pay to work with it.
But actually, it seems it only manages to exist because there is a social organization and the salaries are paid out of public funds.
Another Big Science project that Brazil took part in was the genomic networks ''
For a long time, it was important to train human resources.
``It was to train people to work in a different way.
One can look upon the genomic networks as a Big Science project.
It's a way of working that requires that a molecular biologist acts as an IT specialist, so that he has to acquire bio-IT training.
This obligation to work collectively, whereby one person is dependent on the next, is modern in science.
Brazil decided to enter this type of knowledge production.
When I was in Holland, I met three people who had come from this network and who were working in companies in Germany.
Three women.
``Regarding access, women in Brazil account for almost half: in some careers more, in others less.
Typically, women are still a minority in physics, mathematics and engineering.
Last year, I suggested to a master's degree student: `Let's see whether these theories we read about in papers apply here'.
Women lose interest and move into the biological or social sciences.
There are certain social expectations that drive women away from one area and into another.
We interviewed girls who had just passed their university entrance exams and several confirmed that they had chosen to study physics against their parents' wishes.
There are always certain stereotypes that make women's lives difficult in certain professions.
There comes a time when they say: `I refuse to spend my entire life fighting this; I've had enough.'
It is true that women largely avoid these careers.
Another explanation is that men go in for technology because they enjoy it.''
``Technology, as a social product, reflects social relations.
With girls, you tend to say: `Come and watch TV with me; we'll read a book.'
They are not encouraged to play with technology.
Many boys we have interviewed explain their option for engineering as follows: `I've always loved technology, building objects has always been my thing.'
But the problems faced by women in these careers are different.
In an ideal model, one expects scientists to have no set time to get home.
They have to come into the lab to check on their experiment at four in the afternoon on a Sunday, or at three in the morning on a Saturday, because science is almost a form of priesthood.
Few women are willing to conduct their lives in this way.
Women have a lot of other interests, because that is how they are raised, culturally speaking.
However, in Brazil, there are elements that result from social disparity that help.
As here the women in science are middle class, they can afford to pay someone to look after their children and they can continue working.
That's impossible in Europe.
If 13% of physics researchers in Brazil are women, in Germany they are 3%.
Is that the impact of nannies on science?
``Not only of nannies, but of large families.
Of the mothers, grandmothers and spinster aunts; there's a social network.
In Europe, you can't rely on your mother.
In Germany, school finishes at noon and children have their lunch at home.
A day care center is extremely expensive.
In Brazil, no matter how expensive it may be, what you earn as a researcher allows you to hire a nanny or pay for a day-care center.''
Flavio Alterthum: Lessons about Brazil's ethanol
Mariluce Moura
At this point, while continuing to teach graduate level courses at the Biomedical Sciences Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Jundiaí Medical College, he excitedly plans to work on other books aimed at this young audience breathing new life into his longtime fascination with story-telling.
The dissemination of science to children is just another challenge in the life of this researcher, who is used to making significant career concessions in order to follow his dreams - which no doubt earned him notable successes, but also some very tough setbacks.
This work reverberated widely in major international newspapers, including The New York Times, and in Brazilian publications, such as O Estado de S. Paulo and Gazeta Mercantil.
The company simply closed its Brazilian subsidiary, under somewhat nebulous arguments, soon after he had announced his retirement from USP to embark on this new project.
Professor Alterthum found himself somewhat lost at that moment, his dreams having crumbled.
But as a teacher par excellence, it was his ability to fully absorb the pleasures of being in front of a group of students, lecturing as well as listening, absorbing questions as they shaped the flow of a fascinating story, as he says, that helped him to recover.
It was at USP where found his ground again, although he was officially retired.
Always restless, he was soon inventing new projects, something he continues to do to this day.
He talks about this path of the researcher and teacher, which sometimes draws curious parallels with the past comings and goings of science and technology in Brazil, in the following interview with Pesquisa FAPESP.
Why this book at this point in your life?
In 1965 I was hired by USP and remain involved there to this day, although I am now retired.
I teach two graduate courses.
I am also active in the Graduate School of the Jundiaí Medical School.
I have worked there for 15 years.
But allow me to answer your question.
There was a little song that spoke of bacilli and, whenever they heard it, they laughed and asked, "Dad, what is a bacillus?"
Of course they knew nothing of microbiology.
My daughters remember the situation, but not the song or who sang it.
How and where did you take the storytelling course?
It was an extension course taught by a professor from Minas Gerais, an expert on Guimarães Rosa, I don't recall her name.
I always enjoyed telling stories to my daughters, in my own way.
And she told the stories of Guimarães Rosa by the book.
I told her I didn't want to be a storyteller with a fixed script, but have the ability to develop, to invent a story on the spot.
This is somewhat related to how I give my courses, especially in the graduate school.
So there is a relationship between storytelling and being a graduate school professor?
Are you able to look into the eyes of your students or your listeners and see that they are shining.
If I can make people fascinated with microbiology, I am very pleased.
What was the magic, that special thing , that the storytelling course gave to you?
The clear notion that we must listen to people and know how to work with the questions and the knowledge they have.
I`m speaking about interaction, my classes here [at USP] are interactive.
And when there are no questions, I ask the questions.
And in the case of a children's book it was, first, my daughter's question.
Then I was asking the questions to which I wanted to elicit answers and Telma Alves Monezi created the illustrations.
For her, a 4 year old who could not yet read, the pathogen was a drawing of a bacterium with the face of a duck that appears in the book.
How long did you spend in order to get the text as it actually appears in the book?
The first thing I wanted to do for the public to avail themselves of my reasonable knowledge of microbiology - one of the scientific disciplines in which its applications are often the easiest means to understanding - there was a radio program that would discuss some peculiarity of this area every week.
I got to talk about some issues.
For example, the gecko, walking on the ceiling doesn't fall.
Do you know why?
It's because the gecko has a substance with a very high adhesion capacity on its feet, and many scientific papers have explored this in some way.
For example, researchers cloned the gecko's genes that are responsible for producing this substance, introduced these genes to a very simple bacterium, Escherichia coli, which acts like a machine and begins to produce the substance on a large scale.
Another is the spider's web, a natural substance with a very high capacity to withstand impact.
NASA was interested because it wanted to create a material that would cushion better against impact, Formula 1 has similar interests, and today we have just such a material that is created in this way.
I wanted to create a book, a work illustrating some of these things, I proposed this idea to Laertes [Coutinho, cartoonist], but he said that he had too many commitments, and ultimately it didn't work out.
There began the story of the microbiology book.
I like to speculate about the limits of using such knowledge, to experiment with the possibilities of the interactivity of things.
It fascinates me!
There are not many books available nor has there been successful disclosure of such knowledge in a simple, pleasant manner, since the beginning of people's schooling.
I did not even know microbiology existed before entering university.
Your book ends with the question "But Dad, what is sustainability?".
So to summarize for our readers, what is the path that the book takes in order to explain to children what a microbe is.
In fact, summarize a little bit the idea of the book.
So, who are these microbes?
Bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, viruses ...
Where do they live?
What do they do?
Only bad things?
Or do they also do good things?
Tell about what they do in nature, good and bad.
Because, in addition to talking about diseases, I also discuss the positive applications of microorganisms: production of food, alcoholic beverages, antibiotics, and fuel, like in the case of ethanol.
We explain the importance to ruminant organisms of having a particular microbiota in their rumen (a specialized part of the digestive tract) and so on and so forth.
There is a lot to the notion that we are complex beings, and that all macroorganisms are, in a certain way, like an immense colony of microorganisms.
It's funny that this scares most people is it not?
It's because this is a little known fact: we have more microorganisms in our bodies than we do cells.
Or rather, there are 100 trillion microorganisms in the gut.
And that is just talking about bacteria.
Viruses don't even count because it's not possible to estimate this.
We are made up more of microorganisms than we are of ourselves.
It's an incredible thing!
There are trillions of individuals producing something toxic.
I became aware of your work in the early 1990s, thanks to your research on ethanol.
One of your projects, having to do with the application of microorganisms in the production of alcohol, had yielded a magic patent number in the United States, 5 million, which was, incidentally, also front page news in the Gazeta Mercantil at that time.
I'll try to summarize this story.
At university, it is interesting to think about how we end up becoming an expert in some matter.
In fact, I went to Bath to study the membrane of S. cerevisiae, or rather, the fatty acids of membrane phospholipids - the unsaturated ones.
With this knowledge, I later worked with the action mechanism of antibiotics active in the yeast membrane.
I became interested, I thought it was a great opportunity to employ my sound knowledge of this yeast.
I went to visit alcohol production plants to see how fermentation was being done, because it is one thing in the university where we work in volumes of 50, 100, 200 milliliters, and quite another in a factory using 300 or 400 thousand liter fermentation tanks.
I acquired a great deal of knowledge, became involved with professors at Esalq [Luiz de Queiroz Agricultural College], from there I worked as a consultant for some time at IPT [São Paulo Institute for Technological Research] in the area of alcohol fermentation, and I was working on this when I thought that I should really go to a more advanced research center.
I met Professor Lonnie Ingram, of the University of Florida, and I thought, "Wow, this guy does really cool work on alcohol fermentation."
I applied for a grant from CNPq [the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development in Brazil], to go and work with Prof.
I arrived at his laboratory, began to work with alcohol.
I got interested in this line of research and wrote a short letter to CNPq saying: "I would like to change my project because they are also starting a new project in the area of alcohol."
In fact, they were already working with a genetically modified organism.
I have a lot of luck.
Talking a gene from one organism and transferring it to another is easy to do.
But this gene must then be expressed.
Furthermore, the gene needs to remain stable within the new host organism and also have a long period of productivity.
And it was precisely this that the Americans knew how to do.
The group was very strong in terms of molecular biology, genetics, the technical aspects of transferring genetic material, it was just a good understanding of the physiology of the bacterium that was lacking.
When the research trials began, we only managed to produce a very small amount of alcohol.
With the adaptations I was making in the process, the microorganism began to produce a sufficient quantity of alcohol, which ultimately became interesting from a technological standpoint.
The physiological processes of an organism are always dependent on multiple variables.
You adjust the pH, mess with the temperature, add some substance that interferes with or slows the rate of growth.
Adjust the concentration of a particular salt, or of a cation or an anion.
And in this case, for an organism that has never produced alcohol.
We simply wanted the organism to produce the greatest quantity of alcohol possible - and it turned that when we gave sugar to the organism, it was able to produce alcohol.
That's what we did and it was a great result.
What is even more interesting though, is that we used some of the properties of Escherichia coli, which has the ability to use many different sugars.
Normally, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can not ferment these sugars that exist in nature.
With the genes that we introduced from our bacteria, the microorganism began to use sugars, and began producing ethanol from xylose.
And "our bacteria" is the very E.
Zero.
The patent came out in 1991.
We have to think that countries were, and still are today, heavily dependent on petroleum.
Dependent not only on fuel, but also dependent from the standpoint of the entire industrial complex.
And alcohol could have competed with gasoline.
At that time, the oil and gas industry was very powerful, as it is today, and did not want to see alcohol being used in any country.
Even here in Brazil, at that time, the price of ethanol was not competitive with that of gasoline, so everyone thought that alcohol did not need to be produced.
So much so that in the late 1990s, Brazil nearly terminated the Pro-Alcohol Program.
But after oil prices increased ...
Increased again, then alcohol became more interesting.
But no one even talked about pollution, sustainability.
Anyhow, the ethanol issue began to turn into something more desirable and increased interest in getting ethanol from cellulose, the new generation of ethanol, a course already followed for five years ...
It is the pursuit of technologies for ethanol production on a new base.
To produce ethanol, you cut the sugarcane, take it to the production plant, remove the juice, and ferment it to produce ethanol.
For the hemicellulose, our process was adequate.
And when I returned from the United States, ran to numerous plants in the interior of São Paulo, saying, "Look, there is a process that allows the hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse.
From this hydrolysis you can make alcohol.
This will produce about 10% to 15% more alcohol if we develop the technological processes".
There in the United States we did this on a small scale.
These two raw materials are already in the factory.
And why not?
Because the chemical breakdown of cellulose is difficult to do.
From an industrial point of view, it's not possible.
You can break down cellulose, there are enzymes for that, but it is not yet economically viable.
What I find interesting in this whole story, is that at the end of last year I went to Campinas, to CTBE [National Laboratory of Bioethanol Science and Technology].
I went to see what was being proposed, second and third generation ethanol, and so on.
And I wasn't surprised when the researchers there told me the following: "We`ve invited you here because we want to talk a little bit about E. coli."
They were trying to resuscitate it.
My process was developed 17 years ago.
It's an old process
What is your expectation regarding the technologies that are being developed right now?
When I was still working as a researcher on this subject I thought that the question would be resolved very quickly from the technological point of view.
My experience is with chemical hydrolysis.
And I managed to do it, there are several graduate students who have done work with chemical hydrolysis, followed by fermentation.
We have achieved the most promising results yet, like those of the Americans.
It is a matter of having enough money to do it on a larger scale and seeing if they can get the same results.
If you want to go to scale, you have do tests.
It is not a chemical reaction, in which you just put a pound or 10 pounds or 100 pounds, and it will always be the same.
It's not like this with microbiology.
One must invest in research and this is something that factories here in Brazil don't like to do.
When I was making my round of visits to sugar cane processing plants, I would try to generate interest in my ideas with them and the question was always "how much more money will we make?".
Never "how much will be need to invest?".
I think that the cleanest way to do this will be when we have enough enzymes to breakdown all of these macromolecules.
We will use the old and classic yeast method of producing alcohol from glucose.
Are we still a long way from achieving this?
From an industrial point of view, we are long way away.
I believe that we have adequate knowledge of cell metabolism.
Microorganisms have control over their own metabolic activity.
Ourselves and microorganisms, because, biochemically, you are just like a bacterium.
The organism has a sort of saving mechanism.
When you take such a biomass, in which there are many different sugars together, the microorganism will first have to use one of these sugars in order to then be able to use a different sugar.
The biomass is still very large, with a complex chemical mix, and it won't be possible to achieve this.
At what time in the future should this become possible?
And alcohol is very interesting because we are highly dependent on oil prices.
I'm not only talking about in Brazil but worldwide.
Economically and culturally as well.
I'm a little bit skeptical when I hear people say "No, but alcohol is less polluting than gasoline."
Sure it is!
But price does not enter into this account.
This is why I still think that if the price of oil is high, great.
If oil prices go down (and Brazil has prospects of seeing the price of oil go down due to pre-salt), this will affect the use of alcohol.
Do you consider your work with Escherichia coli to be the peak of your entire research career?
Or an aggregate to other studies?
I was always very much split between my teaching and research activity.
University culture demands that you combine research, teaching and extension.
The university has a responsibility to train people.
But is it not desirable to train people while also doing research?
You have courses in areas where you do not do research and achieve excellence in training people.
But like I said, I think it's important to be a good teacher.
This takes time.
Each time you repeat a class, you have to think about it, what worked, what didn't work, and what you can modify.
How did your teaching work and your research contribute to the book Microbiology?
This textbook was written primarily for students in the field of medicine, particularly undergraduate and graduate level students.
I'm always trying to spread information about microbiology.
Where does your fascination with microbiology come from?
He took out a photograph of my mother with a baby on her lap.
"Your mother was my German teacher."
This professor, whose name was Lúcio de Carvalho Lima, was a wonderful person in my life.
He died a long time ago.
He was the one who motivated me.
After I finished the course, he invited me to be his teaching assistant the following two years.
He was completing his application to be a full professor.
And I helped him with this work.
What was the subject of the thesis?
The production of pyocyanin, which is a pigment from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
After I finished college in 1964, he invited me to be his assistant.
He was an excellent teacher.
Returning to your book, some editions were done in partnership with the microbiologist, Luiz Rachid Trabulsi.
In fact, he started the book project alone, right?
Trabulsi had already completed two editions.
He started when he was at the Medical School at USP, then he went to the São Paulo School of Medicine.
Some time later, when I was head of the department at USP, he joined the department.
I already had a strong connection with him because I was very involved with the Brazilian Society for Microbiology.
I served as the treasurer, secretary, president, and vice-president.
After many years I was the editor of the Journal of Microbiology (Revista de Microbiologia) while he was president of the society.
After the second edition of the textbook, he invited me to be a co-editor.
We completed the third and fourth editions together.
You've gone from writing a technical manual to creating a story for children.
How do you foresee the next few years of your productivity?
I'm working on another book to fill this gap.
I reached the end of graduate school to the initial phase of education.
There is an interface here that I want to fill.
But this book has stayed on standby, so to speak.
The impact of the children's book was amazing to me.
In just a month after being launched, the book was nearly sold out already.
750 copies were printed.
I was responsible, together with Telma, for this print run, did you know that?.
We are going to make a book about sustainability and there are people asking me to do another book about sexually transmitted diseases.
These are ideas that are just appearing.
I don't want to do it alone though.
I want to see if I can get people who have this ability, of being able to put stories on paper in a way that is enjoyable, easy to understand, and based on accurate knowledge.
If you had to summarize your career, would you say that there is a stage when you focused more on research and then came back to teaching?
My departure from the university occurred for the following reason.
In 2003 there was a possibility that an American firm, which had acquired the rights to patent number 5 million, would set up its operations here in Brazil.
They had been talking with an ethanol production plant in Goiás where they wanted to initiate a new production process using our bacteria.
I had already completed many years of service, and in October I requested permission to retire, because in January I expected to start working with the private firm.
And there I was, retired.
The American company had no strategic vision.
But do you know who the owner of this new firm is?
He wanted to destroy the company that developed our process at the University of Florida.
And what was that company?
It's called Quadrex.
It never even really got started.
It was all settled in the United States when Bio Energy, which was the original firm, was purchased by Quadrex.
So you mean that your difficult experience had nothing to do with the university?
It was the private industry that frustrated me at this time, an American company that was going to do a project in Brazil that would have been the pinnacle for me in terms of pursuing work that I had started in the laboratory and taking it to an industrial scale.
I was cut off at that moment and I missed the bus.
No, because it was not yet licensed, since the company gave up.
The company had purchased a license to use the patent.
But the patent was still held by the University of Florida, until it was bought by a Japanese plant that was producing alcohol from sawdust using our bacteria.
Sawdust is also the same thing (as sugarcane), cellulose and hemicellulose.
They sent me $340.
I was really happy because I had earned that $340.
What I find interesting is that all of this brought me satisfaction.
This is the funny side of the story.
Because it's obvious that I had never planned on making money.
It's interesting that the news about the patent came out in the New York Times.
It was then that O Estado de S. Paulo, reading the New York Times, learned of the existence of a Flavio Alterthum.
The news came out here in Brazil and I was interviewed on the Jô Soares show, Fantástico, Jornal Nacional, and on CNN.
People like to be on the crest of a good wave.
In fact, I am happy.
