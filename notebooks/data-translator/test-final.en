The news came out here in Brazil and I was interviewed on the Jô Soares show, Fantástico, Jornal Nacional, and on CNN.
His wife was born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and with many friends on this side of the frontier, Izquierdo left Argentina in 1973, "when the political situation was very threatening", and headed for the homeland of his wife.
There will always be something that will make this be eternally mysterious.
In this line of work, I would highlight the discoveries of the mechanisms of action of nicotine and amphetamine, and later on, of beta-endorphin on the memory.
The second important contribution was the study of the real molecular mechanisms of the memory, above all in the hippocampus.
You don't have to do this.
In them, we use memories that are similar to those that humans can declare.
Animals learn literally not to respond as they used to respond, not think as they used to think, and not to do as they used to do.
Instead of going to get money, you turn about when you see the window closed.
You do this on three or four days.
This can be done until the hippocampus finally learns not to respond any more.
So, some we extinguish or repress.
Depression is the most frequent cause, but less serious than amnesia, which is the failure or lack in general of declarative memory.
-- To recover a general function, yes; but not to recover each memory, of course.
It cannot, for example, do a good long-term potentiation or recognize a novelty, which are other things that the hippocampus does.
After the attack of September 11, 2001, a bit by influence from the Turks, the Americans started using more the technique for extinction, which was even somewhat forgotten in the United States.
-- It can be many things, but usually it is absent-mindedness.
With me, or with other people who once in a while are surrounded by students or reporters, the blank happens when I am submitted to questions from a lot of people at the same time.
There's a fantastic book written by a great American psychologist, Daniel Schacter, which is called The Seven Sins of Memory.
You recall the situation and you go there, to the window.
You read the word `tree' and an infinity of images of trees passes by in your head.
For those who do not the eyesight to read, listening to someone telling a story is excellent for the memory.
Funes was an individual who had a perfect memory, probably deriving from an accident.
Among the sciences in Brazil, neurosciences are one of the branches that worked out well.
Are you in favor of the project for the International Neurosciences Institute in the capital of Rio Grande do Norte?
-- If they manage to turn the institute into a reality, it can be a magnificent enterprise.
Private enterprise in Brazil does not have a habit of contributing to science.
I must be a mixture, a sort of (laughs) Meligeni of science (the former tennis player Fernando Meligeni was born in Argentina and was naturalized a Brazilian).
People who earn less that R$ 79 a month.
So this air of lightness is very good for some things, but it is not good for them all.
Afterwards he spent some time at Manchester University, in England, at CERN -- European Organization for Nuclear Research, at the University of Brasilia (UnB) and at the Polytechnic College of Paris, from which he retired.
The military coup of 1964 interrupted an important experience in the country's university level teaching and forced the physicist to go abroad, as he could not manage to work within his own country.
For example, he revealed that Brazil has lost out on projects within the CERN to countries such as Pakistan.
All, I must add, with a great deal of enthusiasm.
Thus, suppose that we were to study a certain particle named A, there are other nuclear processes that also produce this particle A. It's not only the plasma.
In Europe with Germany, Poland, Sweden, Russia and Romania.
All of them read considerably and were tremendously politicized.
Gleb Wataghin accepted you then, immediately?
I replied: "I do, Professor".
And he: "And, Sir, you want to be a physicist?"
Was it then that you entered into the world of particle physics?
-- It was.
He told me that sunset in the Alps was a spectacle and at night I would be able to see the Milky Way with millions of stars.
Shortly afterwards I got proof of the rage that he felt for me.
At the same time, I got to know that Unesco had been offering study scholarships abroad.
In cosmic rays?
And he made the recommendation that the lecturers return to the universities.
During the first phase ,I remained for eight years in Geneva.
But, it is a different machine because the conditions for accelerating electrons are very different from those of proton accelerators.
I had participated in discussion groups concerning the founding of the university with friends interested in improving university level teaching.
until 1970, the Polytechnic College of USP had a department of mathematics and the Philosophy School had another.
Why is there the belief that Darcy Ribeiro was the great inspiration behind the UnB?
-- He had an enormous influence on the actual existence of the university, but he wasn'tthe inspirational force.
Anísio perceived the need for specialists to relate how the university should function within their own area such as medicine, engineering, biology, chemistry etc.
In the end, after a lot of work as an adviser, I ended up deciding to come to Brasilia as if it were something natural within my work, without having received a formal invitation.
The university was created by Juscelino, but the law was only published during President João Goulart's time.
-- Because it was impossible to stay.
But the students did not complain, they understood.
It was a contract, already signed by Weisskopf, for me to return to the CERN.
Therefore, one can see that Fernando Reinach is an exemplary synthesis character, a type of concrete metaphor of a contemporary economics fundamental process, lato sensu, which runs from scientific discovery, made easier by an intensive professionalism of the Researcher'smétier , to the production of wealth via the appropriation and transformation of knowledge, or that is to say, technological innovation in products and services through companies.
Research in Brazil has had various phases.
-- I believe that this idea had already existed.
They didn't understand the new technology that the young researchers understood very well.
In biology this took a lot more time.
Thematic projects were this: each one did a part and thus it was possible to go further.
When we published the tender for the selection of the laboratories, it was these young people who said "I do".
The majority were between 25 and 30 years of age.
And the idea that I had just had was exactly of this type.
I felt personal resistance towards my very own idea.
It had to represent a major challenge, but one which was not impractical.
I spoke with both of them before making out the document and they believed that it would be possible to do it.
And was there still a doubt as to whether the project's bioinformatics would be done here?
Afterwards we brought in Paulo Arruda, who brought with him André Gouffeau (the French scientist who had coordinated the sequencing of theSaccharomyces ), when we thought that it would be necessary to have a steering committee from abroad.
In the end, we were dealing with a band of young people and there was the need to have some, people with experience, who would intermingle between the researchers and FAPESP.
On the other hand, I wanted to be a sequencer, because it was probable that my laboratory would be one of those that knew most about how to sequence and it was this area that could well have given us the most problems.
There were various amusing things.
The people abroad wanted to wait to load them later and I said "you can load them as we'll be working here".
Has this new way of carrying out science influenced other areas or is it restricted to genomics?
We were no longer eating crumbs from the outside of the table.
Consequently it's not really a genome project.
Fair enough, they were very large and it wouldn't have been possible to map the complete genome.
In spite of being difficult projects, they weren't at the maximum difficulty of theXylella -- probably easier because then we know how to tackle them.
What has been the legacy of the genome project for science?
Other projects -- proteomes, crystallography --, if you were to ask what is the absolute end point, unquestionably, for the end of the project, there would be no answer.
An analogy that I make is the following: there is a gap between two rocks, I come running and jump.
In the manner in which democratization returned, this began to change.
It's not a sufficiently strong movement to result in a turnaround.
The problem is the following: How much risk is the private sector willing to take?
Consequently the entrepreneur thinks: I'm going to and I'll lobby for not freezing prices.
The country's Judicial System is difficult, the patents system doesn't work.
One thing is to have a law, another is to discharge it.
When one has something that is on the scientific frontier, well in front, the market is global.
If he is good, he will quickly learn to work in another way.
Few companies in the world do research.
I don't mean to say that I'm against the proposal, quite the contrary.
Maybe AsGa has good data, because, as we have always worked with the Law on Information Technology, we put R&D on the books.
A new product?
Now, there are other problems in Brazil: first, constant changes in the law, and second, the interest rates, which oblige businessman to have a short term vision.
For example, two years ago, my head of the development area had a doctorate.
They don't understand, and it is not for them to understand.
I would say that few people from the university realize this.
That is why I think that research at the university is extremely important.
I never studied any discipline from the area of specialization where I worked.
-- This attempt to go back to Brazil began in 1968.
When we came back, we started to attract more people than this original nucleus.
After 1968, was there a change of professors there as well?
The brigadier who arrived regarded that system as madness, and came into conflict with the professors.
I needed to take care, because that was public money, I had to call for tenders, etc.
I think that this experience was more important even than the course itself.
No way you can compare ITA's teaching staff with Unicamp or USP.
My hobby is being president of AsGa, my profession is being a counselor on unpaid councils.
In those days, there was no software, and the only solution was to make a very simple program.
It would only add up and subtract, something that today one of the simplest little calculating machines does with a capacity that is a thousand times greater.
We didn't even think of initials or numbers.
On return, I got a scholarship from the CNPq, and stayed until my doctorate.
That wasn't practical.
For us who were working in the area, it had become obvious that this system was going to be the dominant one.
At the time the Law on Information Technology began, the Special Secretariat for Information Technology (SEI) contracted Unicamp to create the Microelectronics Institute, and I was going to run it.
There I found other colleagues from my class from my days at ITA, we started to drink, and after telling them of my career, one of them turned to me and said: "How much money do you need?".
Thiswas now at the end of the 1980s.
Even so, he advocates the use of remedies: the greatest advances in medicine are due to the adoption of new drugs.De
Since 1985, he has published 217 scientific articles in international magazines.
According to him, he has only lost one, in the first instance, was the case started by one of the institutions where he gives lessons -- the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) -- for using staff from the university as volunteers in clinical studies.
-- At least two thirds of medicines act like a placebo [an innocuous substance].
In this situation, is it better to consume the medicine or to stop taking it?
Physicians are not very scientific at all.
They are personal decisions, without any kind of scientific thinking or methodological control.
This is an important issue.
-- I assess scientific works and clinical studies, and there's a difference between the two of them.
Not in the scientific article, only the tables and graphs, and this is questioned.
They are effective because we follow a given model of assessment.
Why should people take medicines with a doubtful effect?
How much does it cost to develop a medicine in Brazil?
The me-too is a structural analog, which makes it possible to escape from patent law in Brazil and in some countries, but not in the United States.
I'm doing this with a product from the Cristália laboratory, lilafil, which is being called the Brazilian Viagra.
Besides this, we could make medicines whose clinical assessment isn't expensive, like the Viagra analog, where one wants to know whether the person has an erection.
It's different from a treatment for Alzheimer's, in which patients have to be treated for a year and a series of examinations carried out.
Do you think that, in Britain, they're going to want a factory throwing out its chemical waste next door?
If it were in football, I would be underestimating.
Part of my production too is not from Brazil, but from when I was in England.
-- There are two aspects: one is to develop a medicine, the other is price.
One thing is wanting to develop a medicine because it's an interesting investment from the economic point of view and deciding how to do this.
On this aspect, I think that the function of the scientist who wants to get there is to run after it.
If he's selling the product he created, he has to know who can buy it.
-- A patent office at a university is a no-go, a shovel of lime on the public universities.
-- I get the impression that our university system has become very polarized with regard to the question of what is public and what is private.
I said: "Zero per cent".
Isn't it necessary to have clear rules?
You have to have results, not rules.
-- At a second moment.
Mariluce Moura and Neldson Marcolin
This bunch of films that is today once again in circulation, mainly on the cable TV channels, is inside an original enterprise that justifiably took the name of Farkas Caravan.
He makes a reference to you at the beginning...
And I came here in 1930.
I though that that would be the biggest revolution that we could make, because Brazilians did not know Brazil, there was no television to show everything.
The people were few, but very competent, beginning to film the projects that we had done.
-- I had that possibility, at Fotoptica.
We went, and we filmed what there was of interest.
Is it something that joined up bits from Viramundo, Memórias do cangaço, Nossa escola de samba [Our Samba School] [1965] and Subterrâneos do futebol [The Soccer Underground][1970]?
And in this Carnets brésiliens are many pieces of documentaries joined together?
Even so, was it your wish to create a documentary center in São Paulo?
The other day, I went to the house of my daughter Beatriz, to see the filed wreckage of my life, and I saw the negatives of the photographs taken at the filming.
There are many of them.
But in our area we were very united politically.
I was never connected with any party.
You take a thousand photos to use 10 or 20.
Anyway, I thing that, for me, the main thing was always this thing here, that I am going to show you.
Mine was like that
I went there, I looked up Rudá [de Andrade], who was a friend of mine, and Professor [José] Marques de Melo, and I offered myself, ``Who knows, you may need me in the cinema department''.
Paulo Emílio Salles Gomes and Maria Isaura Pereira de Queiroz were part of it.
I wrote it in 1972, and I defended it in 1974, 1975, I think, with another bench.
TV Senado [Senate TV] bought a batch of over 20 films, Canal Brasil [Brazil Channel] bought some...
And, although I have the rights, I distribute a small part to all the directors.
It appears to have worked, but I am not certain.
Did you go as far as to accompany this experiment of his?
He certainly wanted to detect cosmic rays that crash into particles from the Earth's atmosphere and give rise to other particles that are difficult to be detected and registered on the photographic plates of those days.
I think it was destroyed.
When I reached the age for studying at university, we were at war.
It's the fifth generation.
The need for a Brazilian view of science
Unicamp researcher discusses the challenges necessary to improve Brazil's academic production
Finding new strategies to improve and make the most of Brazil's scientific and technological production is one of the chief concerns of Léa Velho, one of the country's leading experts in the sociology of science.
The people from the countries that actually have biological diversity end up cooperating just to enable the foreigners to gain access to these resources, and not because of their competence.''
When I can do as I please, i.e., when I work alone with resources I myself obtained, I do not negotiate anything.
Successful countries, from the innovation point of view, have more dynamic cooperative activities.
But from this to generalizing the ``sandwich'' as a training policy for human resources ''
Companies in countries such as Japan and South Korea encourage their technicians to get degrees outside the country and return abroad from time to time, to keep track of new developments.
Is there any way out of this paradox?
These people know where to look for knowledge and interact with those who produce it.
But we will only find out in the future whether things are actually changing.''
This is related to the humanities' characteristics, in that researchers write about their societies to be read by their societies.
How is this a loss ?
Is it possible to compare Brazil and other Latin American countries?
They have three Nobel prizes.
I'm terrified when institutions such as the Campinas Agronomic Institute or Embrapa have to get money from outside and are driven into solving the problems of large agricultural concerns.
I started working at the CNPq in 1978.
Nobody does research, then makes it available for companies and sees the companies using it.
Development for a company is carried out jointly.
At that time, people believed in the process's linearity.
This changed when the key word became interaction.
The idea is to put the players together.
The issue is how to absorb the human resources trained through these projects.
They were identified by a firm in Germany and went to work there because here they had no job opportunities other than in academia.''
How is Brazil doing regarding the difficulties for women to get ahead in science ?
Here at Unicamp, they have accounted for about twelve percent for the last twenty years.
The literature indicated that women's maths performance, up to more or less the sixth or seventh grade, was similar to boys'.
One might think that it is a skill-related inclination.
Is technology masculine?
The first edition had a print run of 750 copies and sold out quickly.
After writing the most widely respected microbiology textbook in the country, after four decades of serious research work, you decided to create a book about microbiology for children.
The title of the book asks, "What is a microorganism?", an idea that has lain dormant since my daughters were 5, 6 years old.
What was the song that spoke of bacilli in those years?
At USP, about 20 years ago.
It was interesting because the course changed some of my ideas about storytelling.
What is the possible connection between these things?
Perhaps many people have this knowledge, but the teacher and actor who can really speak to their audience, both realize when they are captivating.
Then, in class, the thread of "storytelling" is the student's question or your own repertoire of familiar questions.
Perfect.
But how was the experience of translating what you normally present to young students to a much younger audience with a smaller repertoire of knowledge?
Two and a half years.
If there is a potential fascination with scientific knowledge for all ages, why does scientific culture seem to be so lacking among, for example, Brazilian elementary and high school students?
And from there I take each group and talk a little bit about it.
A typical adult has 1014 different microorganisms in their gut.
Two months after I finished my doctorate in 1971 at USP, I went to the University of Bath in England, to do a postdoc.
I went there to work with the physiology of yeast and had chosen to study Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
This is where my luck in understanding alcohol fermentation and the bacteria itself, which does not normally ferment and produce alcohol, came into play.
What exactly was the knowledge that you contributed to this line of research in Florida?
You need to tune, to harmonize the information and behavior of the microorganism.
To be able to transform all of this into ethanol is everyone's dream.
Only nobody has succeeded yet.
In microbiology there are no secrets.
What is the most advanced work in relation to the question of ethanol going on today?
From that point on, we won't need to use genetically modified microorgansims anymore.
If the cells in our body are in the presence of a sugar, for example, glucose in the presence of another sugar, xylose, the cell will use the glucose first, then go to another sugar, then to a third sugar, then to a fourth sugar.
I was always very dedicated to teaching, I've always been a teacher.
I think that it also has a little bit to do with the idea of divulging the subject of microbiology, about access to microbiology.
From people that I met at USP.
But by the time the fifth edition was in progress, he had passed away and I did it alone.
I was really excited about this possibility.
But did you later receive any resources for the licensing of patent number 5 million?
